Whether you're a recent graduate navigating the job market for the first time, contemplating a career change, or aiming for that coveted promotion, the art of resume writing is a skill worth mastering.Below are some tips for resume best practices that can transform your professional narrative into a compelling story - from simple formatting to customization, optimizing keywords, upskilling, and more.Emphasize your skills and accomplishmentsBefore you delve into crafting or updating your resume, keep in mind that the focus of resumes has shifted significantly towards highlighting specific skills and quantifiable achievements. With the growing trend towards hiring based on skills, HR managers look for resumes that showcase candidates' abilities and achievements rather than just their past work experience. \"One mistake job candidates make is not including measurable results on their resume,\" said Cynthia Grande, Career Advisor and Outreach Manager for Office of Advanced Professional Education and Development (OAPED), within UC San Extended Studies. \"For example, did you lead a group of people, save an employer money, or hit a target? You want employers to see how you handle tasks and can enhance their business.\"She also suggests writing a career objective statement at the top of your resume that focuses on your value/experience and skill sets. If you're a first-time job seeker, you can even include school projects if you do not have work experience.Tailor your resume for each job openingWhen writing a resume, customization is key. To make your resume stand out, tailor your skills and achievements to match each job description. For example, if the job opening lists skills first, put your skills on your resume first. It's important to research the company and role to understand which skills are most valued and reflect those on your resume. \"The employer wants to see that you took the time to read through the job description,\" Grande said. \"Remember, it's not about having a long list of skills, but about presenting the right skills in a way that demonstrates your suitability for the specific role you are applying for.\"Use keywords for SEO optimizationIn 2024, it's more crucial than ever to use SEO (Search Engine Optimization) on your resume. That's because many companies employ Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to sift through and prioritize resumes using specific keywords. These keywords typically represent the most pertinent skills and experiences for the job. To successfully navigate these filters, integrate relevant keywords from the job description into your resume. This strategy increases the chances of your resume being noticed and selected for further review. \"Structuring your resume to meet the requirements of an Applicant Tracking System gives you the best chance of having it reach an actual human,\" Grande said. \"For example, if you're applying for a project management position and your resume does not have keywords for that career, you will get screened out.\"Keep the format simpleGrande said the biggest challenge job seekers have with their resume is formatting. She said keeping it clean and simple is the best way to go. For example, she said a Word document is preferable over a PDF. Resumes for mid-level executives and seasoned professionals can be up to two pages, while those with less experience should have a one-page resume. It's important to include strong action verbs in your resume, but also keep it clear and concise. And, don't forget to check and double-check for grammar and spelling errors. \"If an HR hiring manager looks at a resume and it has dates all over the place or can't be read easily, they skip it,\" Grande added.\" If you don't have a lot of work experience, you can include volunteer experiences.\" Meanwhile, she recommends skipping hobbies and interests on your resume.Consider upskillingIn today's dynamic and competitive job market, upskilling has become critical in crafting a compelling resume. With technological advancements and evolving industry demands, staying relevant and adaptable is crucial for professional growth. Demonstrating a commitment to ongoing learning through upskilling not only showcases a candidate's initiative, but also highlights the ability to thrive in a rapidly changing work environment. Incorporating newly acquired skills and certifications on a resume not only enhances your qualifications but also shows employers that you are proactive, resourceful, and ready to contribute to the company's success. Investing in upskilling not only gives your resume an extra boost but also positions you as a valuable asset in today's job market. For many industries, such as tech or sales, certifications are more valued than formal degrees, Grande said. She speaks from experience. Grande, a five-year career counselor, earned a certificate through the UC San Diego Extended Studies Career Advising Program. \"I gained a lot of insight from this course,\" she said. \"It has helped me in my career. Continued education and upskilling show initiative and growth.\" In fact, Extended Studies offers numerous courses and certificate programs for those who want to enhance their careers or even switch careers -- from arts to languages, creative writing, business, healthcare, engineering, data sciences, life sciences, basic sciences, and more. In total, Extended Studies provides 100 different certificates. Most individuals navigate multiple careers throughout their lives, and even those with a single career must periodically update their skills. That's why certificates play a pivotal role in career advancement, and it's something you can highlight on your resume. High school graduates can even opt for certificates in business, programming, or digital arts to kickstart their careers while contemplating future degrees. Extended Studies programs assist high school students in identifying career paths or acquiring valuable skills, like the Problem Solve Like an Expert program in collaboration with the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, which teaches basic programming skills. Even participating in a program like this before entering college or a career will most certainly make your resume stand out.Update or create a LinkedIn profileLinkedIn is incredibly important for anyone looking for a job. Grande suggests including a shortened LinkedIn profile link on your resume, and not a hyperlink, which throws off ATS systems. A robust LinkedIn profile can showcase key projects you have worked on or led. And remember, always keep your LinkedIn profile relevant and professional, because odds are if you're applying for a job, employers will review your LinkedIn, as well as other social media channels, Grande said.Use AI tools cautiouslyIf you have access to AI tools to craft your resume, Grande said it's OK to use them, but be responsible. For example, you can ask ChatGTP to help expand a sentence or bullet point for you but don't ask it to create a full resume. Remember to keep it simple yet customized for each job opening.Name dropGrande said the majority of the students she has advised have gained great employment opportunities through networking. Including referrals on your resume can help you land an initial interview. “For example, if you include the name of an employee from the organization you are applying to on the application, your resume will be moved to the top,” she said.Have your resume up to dateGrande suggests researching the job market for various industries to keep your resume relevant and current. There are a lot of free job market tools available, such as LinkedIn Career Explorer, and more locally to UC San Diego, the San Diego Workforce Partnership has amazing tools for college students, such as personality and skill profiles, as well as on-demand jobs in the market. \"Job market research will prepare you to create a stellar resume,\" she said.Create an elevator pitchWhen crafting your resume, it's a good idea to also create an elevator pitch to go with it, which is a great conversation starter when networking. An effective elevator pitch for your resume not only conveys your professional strengths and aspirations but can also align with the specific job or industry you are targeting. It can also engage potential employers, networking contacts, or recruiters by highlighting an overview of your qualifications, making it an invaluable component in positioning yourself strategically in the competitive job market. \"Having an elevator pitch will help you with your intentions on what you want to do,” Grande said. “When you're always intentional, it helps you in your job.\"Meet with a career advisor for tips on building a good resumeIf you're still stuck on crafting a resume for 2024, it may be a good idea to meet with a career advisor, who can point you in the right direction. Even if you're feeling confident in your resume, you can still have an advisor review it to make sure you are on point. \"The goal of a resume and cover letter is to be invited to an interview. It's like marketing materials,\" Grande said. \"A career advisor can look at your resume to make sure you are successfully highlighting your skills and what value you can bring to employers.\" Job seekers can also take a resume workshop to understand what employers are looking for.Resume Don'tsDo not include color on a resumeAvoid too many linksAvoid using online templatesDo not include your photoAvoid too many font stylesMinimize acronyms\"There's another trend I don't recommend on TikTok where people do a TikTok video resume that includes an elevator pitch. They are clever but not the most professional,\" Grande said.ConclusionGrande said job seekers send out at least 100 to 200 resumes when applying for employment, with the average interview rate being 2% - 5% for applying online. Crafting a compelling resume is an art that can significantly increase your chances of scoring that interview and impacting your career trajectory.Following the above best practices will not only capture the attention of potential employers but will also set you apart in a sea of applicants. Finding your dream job could be as simple as crafting a few carefully chosen words. Your new and improved resume will not only open doors but also lay the foundation for your professional success.Posted:1/4/2024 8:00:00 AMwith0 commentsCommentsBlog post currently doesn't have any comments.Leave commentName:Please enter a name.Email:Please enter email address in correct format.Please enter an email address.Your URL:Comments:Please enter some comments.Stay in TouchHear about upcoming events and coursesSUBSCRIBEWhat's your story?Share your accomplishments, advice, and goals for a chance to be featured.TELL MY STORYCourses & ProgramsDegree CreditInternational ProgramsOccupational Safety and HealthOsher Lifelong Learning Inst.Pre-CollegeNews & EventsEvent CalendarBlogSocial Media DirectoryMedia RoomCommunity & ResearchUCTV & UCSD-TVTeach for UsCalifornia Workforce and Degree Completion NeedsCenter for Research + EvaluationCollaborate With UsStudent ResourcesWorkforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA)​Veterans Education BenefitsRegistration Policies and ProceduresServices for Students with DisabilitiesTuition and FeesPrivacy PolicySite MapSign up to hear aboutupcoming events and coursesSubscribeFollow us today andget inspired!FacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInYouTubeCopyright © 2024 Regents of the University of California.

Start by accepting that it’s going to take some time and effort. Don’t try to sit down and knock it out in an hour – you’re carefully crafting a marketing document. Open strong with a summary of your expertise. Use an accomplishments section after the opener to link your experience to the job requirements. You don’t want to waste space upfront on irrelevant job experience. It’s okay to be selective about what employment, achievements, and skills you include; after all, you should tailor your resume for each position. Give concrete examples of your expertise, quantifying your accomplishments with numbers where you can. Seek input from a mentor or friend who can review it and give you feedback. Lastly, create a personable LinkedIn profile to complement your resume.PostPostShareAnnotateSaveGet PDFBuy CopiesPrintThe resume: there are so many conflicting recommendations out there. Should you keep it to one page? Do you put a summary up top? Do you include personal interests and volunteer gigs? And how do you make it stand out, especially when you know the hiring manager is receiving tons of applications? This may be your best chance to make a good first impression, so you’ve got to get it right.Read more onResumesor related topicsJob searchandCareersAmy Gallois a contributing editor at Harvard Business Review, cohost of theWomen at Workpodcast, and the author of two books:Getting Along: How to Work with Anyone (Even Difficult People)and theHBR Guide to Dealing with Conflict.

You do it because you need to pay the bills and chip away at that looming debt you’re reminded of with every monthly statement.You get an email or text from an old friend, former co-worker, or industry connection that you made years ago about a job opening with a company you’ve been discreetly stalking online for weeks. All you need to do is send over your resume or apply online tonight, and the job is practically yours.It only takes one look at your resume, and you feel defeated. You haven’t touched it in years. It doesn’t even have your most recent job listed, and its overall look and feel hasn’t changed much over time. You’re pretty sure it looks as ineffective as you feel after a long day at work.Then there’s all this talk online about ATS, AI, bots, and algorithms that will “kick you out” if you don’t know how to beat the system. Let me reassure you right now, this doesn’t actually happen.Resume writing is often the most dreaded task for job seekers because either:You have a difficult time talking about yourself in a resume,You have a hard time quantifying skill sets, and your edu-crastination (You like that?) has only instilled in you that quantifying your skills is the only way to get an interview,You have no idea what to do with your overly diversified experience or work history timeline issues like multiple company acquisitions, demotions, or changing job titles;The “dark cloud” of hiring technologies is hanging over you, orYou’re just too exhausted to work on your resume after work.Here are 24 actionable steps you can take to write a resume that lands more interviews and, ultimately, job offers this year.1 | Understand Your Resume’s Role In The Hiring ProcessThe #1 complaint from job seekers in the last five years has been, “My resume isn’t getting in front of the right people!” I get how frustrating, time-consuming, and often discouraging looking and applying for jobs online can be. Understanding your resume’s role in the hiring process is the first step to creating a job-winning resume that gets you unstuck and moving forward confidently.Granted this can vary depending on company size and industry, here’s the SparkNotes version of the typical hiring process:A team leader or manager realizes they need to create or fill a position and notifies the HR team.Someone on that HR team creates a job description based on the team leader/manager’s needs and posts it to the company’s Applicant Tracking System (also known as ATS) which is linked to the company’s Careers page.The HR staff member then posts the job to job boards as well as LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and other sites depending on their budget.The Applicant Tracking software collects resumes and applications from hundreds of job seekers, narrowing down applicants to the most qualified candidates using search terms and “knock-out” questions from the applications.The top qualified candidates (maybe the top 10) will have their resumes looked at by the recruiter or HR team who will have their own checklist of requirements and preferences.Out of the resumes seen, the top candidates (maybe the top 6) will get phone screening interviews.Out of the candidates screened, the top candidates (maybe the top 4) will have their resumes forwarded to that team leader or hiring manager to be considered for an in-person interview.Out of the interviewed candidates, the top candidate (maybe more depending on the hiring circumstances) will get the job offer.2 | Write For All Readers, Not Just BotsNow that you understand your resume’s role in the hiring process, you can see that your resume needs to get through an Applicant Tracking System and two other gateways before you are selected for a job interview. A common misconception about resume writing is that your top priority has to be writing your resume for computers or the bots that operate within ATS.Resume writing is actually a balancing act. You have to write your resume for three different audiences: ATS, a recruiter or HR, and a hiring manager or direct supervisor deciding who will get the interview.ATS is looking at both the digital formatting of your resume and the keywords you’ve included throughout. The HR reader likely has a checklist of requirements and preferences that they use as terms to search, sort, or filter through applicants, so you can’t assume this person will know that you have certain skills and experience based on your job titles. A hiring manager or direct supervisor will then need to decide who is the best fit for the job, the team, and the company as a whole among the handful of applicants that made it this far in the process.3 | Stop Fearing Artificial IntelligenceIf anything, AI is going to make it easier for you to land interviews.Most of the AI-driven features being used by hiring professionals are to write better job postings and improve communications with candidates. AI can also be used to help recruiters and hiring professionals find candidates on networks like LinkedIn based on search terms like position titles and skills—where AI branches out from these search terms to find candidates with similar position titles and skills. LinkedIn is also providing AI-driven features for recruiters that will recommend profile matches before jobs are even posted.Other hiring software, like Applicant Tracking Systems, have similar AI integrations. What’s most exciting is that some ATS have AI capabilities that will help gauge an applicant’s level of experience beyond calculating years of work history listed keyword placement. Instead of just looking at keywords, it’s looking at everything you’re saying in your resume and drawing conclusions about your skills and experience.If you’re providing enough context throughout your resume to show the results or outcomes an employer can expect from you based on past performance, AI will help drive your resume to the top of applicant lists.4 | Narrow Down Your Job TargetThe most effective, job-winning resume is going to be targeted for a specific job. If you’re applying for jobs online, this means the specific job posting. If you’re networking, this means you need to get laser-focused on what your ideal role is to position yourself as the best fit for the job that you want.Targeting your resume shows that you understand the goals of the role you’re applying for or pursuing in your job search. A targeted resume will also demonstrate that you can meet and exceed those goals based on your track record over the course of your work history and educational background.If you can’t narrow down your job target, you should either create a targeted resume for each of your job targets or consider working with a career coach.Career Exploration & Transition Coachingis highly recommended if you need help getting a clear direction and focus for your job search!5 | Design Your Resume For ATSThe next step is designing your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems. This software has been around since the 90s—so there’s a ton of outdated information online about it—but ATS has evolved dramatically over the last 5-10 years. Here’s what you need to know:Applicant Tracking Systems can’t read text placed in headers or footers, so be careful where you place your contact information in MS Word Documents.Applicant Tracking Systems can’t read text placed in text boxes, so avoid using these to organize information on your resume.Applicant Tracking Systems scan the text from left to right and often don’t read and store information formatted in columns correctly.Applicant Tracking Systems don’t care about bold, underlined, italicized, colored, or color-filled text so you can use these design elements strategically to make your resume easier to skim.Applicant Tracking Systems don’t see photos, graphs, or charts embedded in your resume (JPG or PNG files)—just don’t rely on them to convey important information that isn’t in the text.Applicant Tracking Systems can read PDFs but are known to read MS Word Documents more accurately—heavily formatted and graphically designed PDF resumes specifically often can’t be previewed in ATS.To maximize your chances of getting through ATS, start with a new Microsoft Word Document and organize your information in a one-column layout. Make sure your contact information can be found in the body of your resume rather than in the header or footer.Keep in mind that Applicant Tracking software is designed to look for certain keywords and text arrangements to fill in a form with your information within the software. Use standard section headings (Skills or Areas of Expertise, Experience, Education, Certifications, etc.) to make sure your information is parsed and organized in this software’s searchable database correctly.Related Article:ATS Explained: How Resume Screening Software Works6 | Use Color Strategically (& Conservatively)If your resume looks like every other black-and-white resume from the 90s, you’re not helping yourself at all. Your resume isn’t just a list of your work history and skills—it’s a marketing document, and color psychology is a key branding tactic used in marketing. Your personal brand, or how you want to present yourself to employers using both visual cues and messaging, is directly linked to your personality. Would you want to hire a black-and-white personality?Use color strategically to impact an employer’s perspective of you. Keep your resume looking professional by using conservative color for your name, section headings, and other design elements sparingly. Pick no more than two colors, but keep the rest of your text easy to read with a standard black font.Is the thought of getting creative with your resume design giving you anxiety? I’ve already done the heavy lifting for you and designed modern resume templates for college students and recent graduates, those making major career changes, mid-career professionals, and IT professionals in a variety of color schemes.Struggling to get through Applicant Tracking Software? These templates are designed to get through ATS and stand out in all the right ways when in front of hiring decision-makers7 | Include Your LinkedIn Profile LinkIf you’re not on LinkedIn, you're already falling behind other applicants. Why? Your LinkedIn profile is often the first stop during a background check because it’s an easy and free way for HR teams to validate your work history. I won’t even get into how LinkedIn recommendations on your profile are the new letters of recommendation…Related Article:How To Get Raving LinkedIn RecommendationsA LinkedIn profile also enables you to humanize your job application when it’s less professional on a resume such as non-career-related volunteer experience, side projects, and work-life balance activities. It’s your profile on a networking platform, so it should be more approachable and conversational. An even more important advantage is this: You can add more information to your LinkedIn profile than a targeted 1-2 page resume will permit.Add your LinkedIn profile link to your contact information on your resume and indicate at the end of your resume that more information can be found on your profile to speed up the background check and boost your application.8 | Remove Dates Older Than 2010Can you believe that 2010 was 14 years ago?! Unless you’re applying for a job that specifically wants 15+ years of experience with a particular skill (which is becoming less common for many executive-level roles), listing dates on your resume prior to 2010 is only going to age you… and not in a good way.Age bias and discrimination are serious issues that impact job seekers over 45 more often than they realize, but there are other negative responses to drawing attention to your age on your resume. For example, your extended years of experience may be threatening to a potential younger manager. The extended years of experience may also imply that you’re only looking to bridge an employment gap until a better-fitting job opportunity presents itself.The extended years can give the impression that you’re fixated on outdated methodologies, best practices, and technologies rather than present you as a forward-thinking professional.I often work with seasoned job seekers in their 50s and 60s looking for their last job before retirement, drastically changing careers, or returning to work after an early retirement. Eliminating half of their careers from their resumes can be terrifying at first but so rewarding in a matter of weeks. Removing work history prior to 2010 can bring focus to your resume and show employers that you’re more interested in the future than your past.Continue reading at offtheclockresumes.com...Help improve contributionsMark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.

Whether you\\'re a recent graduate navigating the job market for the first time, contemplating a career change, or aiming for that coveted promotion, the art of resume writing is a skill worth mastering.Below are some tips for resume best practices that can transform your professional narrative into a compelling story - from simple formatting to customization, optimizing keywords, upskilling, and more.Emphasize your skills and accomplishmentsBefore you delve into crafting or updating your resume, keep in mind that the focus of resumes has shifted significantly towards highlighting specific skills and quantifiable achievements. With the growing trend towards hiring based on skills, HR managers look for resumes that showcase candidates\\' abilities and achievements rather than just their past work experience. \"One mistake job candidates make is not including measurable results on their resume,\" said Cynthia Grande, Career Advisor and Outreach Manager for Office of Advanced Professional Education and Development (OAPED), within UC San Extended Studies. \"For example, did you lead a group of people, save an employer money, or hit a target? You want employers to see how you handle tasks and can enhance their business.\"She also suggests writing a career objective statement at the top of your resume that focuses on your value/experience and skill sets. If you\\'re a first-time job seeker, you can even include school projects if you do not have work experience.Tailor your resume for each job openingWhen writing a resume, customization is key. To make your resume stand out, tailor your skills and achievements to match each job description. For example, if the job opening lists skills first, put your skills on your resume first. It\\'s important to research the company and role to understand which skills are most valued and reflect those on your resume. \"The employer wants to see that you took the time to read through the job description,\" Grande said. \"Remember, it\\'s not about having a long list of skills, but about presenting the right skills in a way that demonstrates your suitability for the specific role you are applying for.\"Use keywords for SEO optimizationIn 2024, it\\'s more crucial than ever to use SEO (Search Engine Optimization) on your resume. That\\'s because many companies employ Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to sift through and prioritize resumes using specific keywords. These keywords typically represent the most pertinent skills and experiences for the job. To successfully navigate these filters, integrate relevant keywords from the job description into your resume. This strategy increases the chances of your resume being noticed and selected for further review. \"Structuring your resume to meet the requirements of an Applicant Tracking System gives you the best chance of having it reach an actual human,\" Grande said. \"For example, if you\\'re applying for a project management position and your resume does not have keywords for that career, you will get screened out.\"Keep the format simpleGrande said the biggest challenge job seekers have with their resume is formatting. She said keeping it clean and simple is the best way to go. For example, she said a Word document is preferable over a PDF. Resumes for mid-level executives and seasoned professionals can be up to two pages, while those with less experience should have a one-page resume. It\\'s important to include strong action verbs in your resume, but also keep it clear and concise. And, don\\'t forget to check and double-check for grammar and spelling errors. \"If an HR hiring manager looks at a resume and it has dates all over the place or can\\'t be read easily, they skip it,\" Grande added.\" If you don\\'t have a lot of work experience, you can include volunteer experiences.\" Meanwhile, she recommends skipping hobbies and interests on your resume.Consider upskillingIn today\\'s dynamic and competitive job market, upskilling has become critical in crafting a compelling resume. With technological advancements and evolving industry demands, staying relevant and adaptable is crucial for professional growth. Demonstrating a commitment to ongoing learning through upskilling not only showcases a candidate\\'s initiative, but also highlights the ability to thrive in a rapidly changing work environment. Incorporating newly acquired skills and certifications on a resume not only enhances your qualifications but also shows employers that you are proactive, resourceful, and ready to contribute to the company\\'s success. Investing in upskilling not only gives your resume an extra boost but also positions you as a valuable asset in today\\'s job market. For many industries, such as tech or sales, certifications are more valued than formal degrees, Grande said. She speaks from experience. Grande, a five-year career counselor, earned a certificate through the UC San Diego Extended Studies Career Advising Program. \"I gained a lot of insight from this course,\" she said. \"It has helped me in my career. Continued education and upskilling show initiative and growth.\" In fact, Extended Studies offers numerous courses and certificate programs for those who want to enhance their careers or even switch careers -- from arts to languages, creative writing, business, healthcare, engineering, data sciences, life sciences, basic sciences, and more. In total, Extended Studies provides 100 different certificates. Most individuals navigate multiple careers throughout their lives, and even those with a single career must periodically update their skills. That\\'s why certificates play a pivotal role in career advancement, and it\\'s something you can highlight on your resume. High school graduates can even opt for certificates in business, programming, or digital arts to kickstart their careers while contemplating future degrees. Extended Studies programs assist high school students in identifying career paths or acquiring valuable skills, like the Problem Solve Like an Expert program in collaboration with the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, which teaches basic programming skills. Even participating in a program like this before entering college or a career will most certainly make your resume stand out.Update or create a LinkedIn profileLinkedIn is incredibly important for anyone looking for a job. Grande suggests including a shortened LinkedIn profile link on your resume, and not a hyperlink, which throws off ATS systems. A robust LinkedIn profile can showcase key projects you have worked on or led. And remember, always keep your LinkedIn profile relevant and professional, because odds are if you\\'re applying for a job, employers will review your LinkedIn, as well as other social media channels, Grande said.Use AI tools cautiouslyIf you have access to AI tools to craft your resume, Grande said it\\'s OK to use them, but be responsible. For example, you can ask ChatGTP to help expand a sentence or bullet point for you but don\\'t ask it to create a full resume. Remember to keep it simple yet customized for each job opening.Name dropGrande said the majority of the students she has advised have gained great employment opportunities through networking. Including referrals on your resume can help you land an initial interview. “For example, if you include the name of an employee from the organization you are applying to on the application, your resume will be moved to the top,” she said.Have your resume up to dateGrande suggests researching the job market for various industries to keep your resume relevant and current. There are a lot of free job market tools available, such as LinkedIn Career Explorer, and more locally to UC San Diego, the San Diego Workforce Partnership has amazing tools for college students, such as personality and skill profiles, as well as on-demand jobs in the market. \"Job market research will prepare you to create a stellar resume,\" she said.Create an elevator pitchWhen crafting your resume, it\\'s a good idea to also create an elevator pitch to go with it, which is a great conversation starter when networking. An effective elevator pitch for your resume not only conveys your professional strengths and aspirations but can also align with the specific job or industry you are targeting. It can also engage potential employers, networking contacts, or recruiters by highlighting an overview of your qualifications, making it an invaluable component in positioning yourself strategically in the competitive job market. \"Having an elevator pitch will help you with your intentions on what you want to do,” Grande said. “When you\\'re always intentional, it helps you in your job.\"Meet with a career advisor for tips on building a good resumeIf you\\'re still stuck on crafting a resume for 2024, it may be a good idea to meet with a career advisor, who can point you in the right direction. Even if you\\'re feeling confident in your resume, you can still have an advisor review it to make sure you are on point. \"The goal of a resume and cover letter is to be invited to an interview. It\\'s like marketing materials,\" Grande said. \"A career advisor can look at your resume to make sure you are successfully highlighting your skills and what value you can bring to employers.\" Job seekers can also take a resume workshop to understand what employers are looking for.Resume Don\\'tsDo not include color on a resumeAvoid too many linksAvoid using online templatesDo not include your photoAvoid too many font stylesMinimize acronyms\"There\\'s another trend I don\\'t recommend on TikTok where people do a TikTok video resume that includes an elevator pitch. They are clever but not the most professional,\" Grande said.ConclusionGrande said job seekers send out at least 100 to 200 resumes when applying for employment, with the average interview rate being 2% - 5% for applying online. Crafting a compelling resume is an art that can significantly increase your chances of scoring that interview and impacting your career trajectory.Following the above best practices will not only capture the attention of potential employers but will also set you apart in a sea of applicants. Finding your dream job could be as simple as crafting a few carefully chosen words. Your new and improved resume will not only open doors but also lay the foundation for your professional success.Posted:1/4/2024 8:00:00 AMwith0 commentsCommentsBlog post currently doesn\\'t have any comments.Leave commentName:Please enter a name.Email:Please enter email address in correct format.Please enter an email address.Your URL:Comments:Please enter some comments.Stay in TouchHear about upcoming events and coursesSUBSCRIBEWhat\\'s your story?Share your accomplishments, advice, and goals for a chance to be featured.TELL MY STORYCourses & ProgramsDegree CreditInternational ProgramsOccupational Safety and HealthOsher Lifelong Learning Inst.Pre-CollegeNews & EventsEvent CalendarBlogSocial Media DirectoryMedia RoomCommunity & ResearchUCTV & UCSD-TVTeach for UsCalifornia Workforce and Degree Completion NeedsCenter for Research + EvaluationCollaborate With UsStudent ResourcesWorkforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA)\\u200bVeterans Education BenefitsRegistration Policies and ProceduresServices for Students with DisabilitiesTuition and FeesPrivacy PolicySite MapSign up to hear aboutupcoming events and coursesSubscribeFollow us today andget inspired!FacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInYouTubeCopyright © 2024 Regents of the University of California.

If you're applying for a tech position, you want your resume to represent you well, at a glance! As a tech recruiter, my work demands that I scour the web and read thousands of resumes a year to find top talent, so I have a lot of relevant experience when it comes to knowing what makes a certain resume stand out over others.When you’re thinking about your resume for a tech job, try imagining that you’re looking for a new book online. You go to the “best seller” section because you’re craving an action-packed thriller. A few titles that catch your attention so you click on the summary to see if you’re interested in buying any of the books. After starting to read the first summary, you stop halfway through because nothing catches your eye. What you might not have even realized was that the last sentence had a major plot twist that would have made you immediately purchase the book. A resume is basically the same thing! If you hide your relevant or enticing skills or job experience, a recruiter can miss it.Before I dive into my resume tips, let me just say that resume writing is an art and not a science. I regularly go to the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C. and don’t understand why certain works of art have long lines of people waiting to see a particular piece. Art is subjective and just because a certain piece doesn't catch my eye, doesn’t mean it won’t resonate with another person. Resumes are much the same way. As a company's needs change and evolve, a resume that didn't receive more than a passing glance today, could be the next great hire a month or two down the road. So make sure to keep updating and honing your resume as you pick up new skills, as well as applying to different jobs!With all that in mind, let me offer a few ways to make this art a little more scientific. Hopefully, my 6 resume tips will help you make your resume as impactful as possible!1) List important information and skills at the top of your resumeThink back to my point about the book summary: had the author put more relevant details in the beginning of the summary, they would’ve made a sale. Think about your resume in the same way. A lot of people will put irrelevant material at the top of their resume, which can take up a lot of space and doesn’t offer me more insights about you. In fact, it can make the recruiter have to work harder to figure out what tech the candidate is actually familiar with—one of the most important things when hiring a software engineer, data analyst or developer. To show a recruiter you are a good fit for the exact role you are applying for, put the most relevant information up top. I’m not going to say what is specifically relevant because this can vary from role to role, but I’ll outline a few options:Clearly list out the technology and tools YOU have hands-on experience with.I’ve listed a brief example below, but feel free to customize based on the role you are applying to and what categories seem relevant.Languages: Java, Python, JavaScriptFrameworks: Spring, Angular, React CI/CDTools: Docker, Git, JenkinsDatabases: MongoDB, DynamoDB, PostgressCloud: AWS Certifications: AWS cloud practitionerList what roles you are interested in.I wouldn’t necessarily do this first in every scenario, but it is good if you are looking for very specific roles or making a career change.Completed or expected degrees.I would only advise this for recent grads and students looking for internships. Otherwise, it can go on the bottom of your resume. I’ve rarely seen a specific degree make or break an application. If a tech recruiter is looking for a specific degree or university, they will likely keyword search your resume for it.2) Use bullet points, NOT paragraphs in the body of your resumeEver read a social media post or email and wish there was a tl;dr section? I’ve seen hundreds of resumes that are pages long due to everything being written in paragraph format. Simple bullet points will make it more likely for your key points to get noticed and ensure more of your resume is getting read through by the recruiter.3) Limit the number of bullet points you useNow hold your horses. Before you start breaking up your paragraphs into bullet points, I want you to think about if that line is an assumed responsibility in your role. If I see someone’s job title is “Software Engineer,” I can assume you’re writing/maintaining code. If it is easily assumed, you don’t need it on your resume. This can take 10 bullets down to 5-6 very quickly. Also focus on YOUR contributions and not what your team was doing. It’s cool that your team created a full-stack application with Vue.js, but if you didn’t touch any of that code, it’s going to come out in your interview. Here are some examples of helpful lines you can include below:Elevator pitch of the application you are working onKey user stories or projects you completedSpecific coding languages and tools you utilized in this roleAchievements or quantifiable results4) Add personality to make your tech resume interestingSome people who prefer the traditional formal resume will disagree with me here, but overall it doesn’t hurt to put some personality in a resume; especially a tech one. I will never forget the time I had an applicant with a single line on her resume that mentioned she built and ran an alpaca farm from the ground up. I wasn’t sure if her tech background was the exact fit for the role, but clearly I HAD to reach out regardless because she sounded interesting. There are a few ways to do this besides building your own alpaca farm. You can have a small section listing hobbies, you can put fun facts in, or you can list organizations and charities you participate in. If you are really confident in your writing skills you can put your personality throughout your resume (you might have noticed I’ve done this in my post if you’re not sick of my humor already). With all of these, the point is to give the recruiter get a sense of who you are and make them want to speak to you. You aren’t going to land the job because of these, but this will make the recruiter want to learn more about you. Now, the key with this is to not go overboard. I mentioned before, it was one line on the resume that caught my attention. It wasn’t random facts that filled a whole section of the resume or drew away from her key skills. I would advise listing these at the bottom or on the side of your resume if the formatting permits.5) Add personal projects, open source contributions and blogsOne of the things that excites me the most is when I see a github or stackoverflow link on a resume. Why? Because I can look into what you’re actually working on and see if you’re trying to tinker with new tech on the side. The tech world is always rapidly changing and new tools are continuously coming out. It goes a long way to show that you are trying to keep up with it and my tech teams always appreciate people who are taking that initiative. Teams also want to hire people that are passionate about things and passionate people are doing side tech projects because they love it. However, keep these off of your resume if you don’t actively update them. It’s great you had a github in college, but if you’re three years out and haven’t made any commits, it’s not showing me much.6) Don’t go overboard with style and formattingThis is another one that is going to spark a debate, but I generally advise not being too complex with style and designs on a resume. Use the tips I mentioned above to grab the recruiter’s attention instead of gimmicks. Also if you are applying to roles in the US, you do not need to provide a picture, marital status, or other personal information that you might have to in other countries. Your skills should speak for you and not your smile.Key tech resume takeawaysRemember—resumes are an art and not a science. My advice is meant to make this art a little more scientific, but just because 20 recruiters pass on your resume, doesn’t mean that something won’t grab the 21st recruiter’s attention. Keep honing your art and you’ll land that next tech job in no time.FacebookLinkedInInstagramYouTubeGlassdoorTech Jobs in McLeanView All of Our Available OpportunitiesCopyright © 2024 Opinions are those of the individual author.

Tech professionals are in high demand. But with so much talent competing for the best jobs, a standard resume won’t cut it. So what are recruiters looking for in a tech resume, and what’s the best way to highlight your skills?A tech resume should be more than a document listing your skills and experience in bullet points. With hundreds of applications to wade through, recruiters often only have a few minutes to get a sense of your personality, creativity, and ability.For tech-newcomers who have recently graduated from a tech bootcamp, your resume is also a chance to show off your transferable skills—and demonstrate how you’ll apply them in your new role.If you’re staring at a blank page, unsure of where to start, you’re not alone. So we’re here with tips, tricks, and examples to help you get your foot through your dream company’s door.Here’s what we’ll cover:Tech resume dos and don’tsBuilding and formatting a tech resumeHow to highlight tech skills on your resumeTech resume examplesFinal thoughtsLet’s get into it!1. Tech resume dos and don’tsCreating a tech resume can be a nerve-racking endeavor,especially for career changers. In the absence of years of experience in the field, your resume is often your one shot to convince recruiters you’re the right fit for their company.It can be challenging to showcase everything you have to offer in a one-page document, but a tech resume doesn’t have to be all-singing, all-dancing. It simply has to quickly and efficiently communicate what you bring to the table.It’s also important to note your resume often won’t even be seen by a human first. With the high amount of resumes being uploaded to job application sites, many companies rely on automatic AI software to filter the resumes before they go to hiring managers or recruiters.If your resume doesn’t include keywords, isn’t readable, or isn’t formatted correctly—the hiring managers may never see it. It’s a harsh reality, but it’s important to know what you’re up against before you start firing resumes off.To help get your application seen by the right people, let’s go through some quick-fire dos and don’ts:Do:Tailor it to specific companies.When recruiters scan a tech resume, they look for the specific keywords listed in the job description. To boost your chances of standing out, tweak your resume for each application and make sure these keywords are highlighted.Talk about tools.In today’s remote-first tech landscape, proficiency with certain tools is a distinct advantage. You’ll want to highlight your stack on your resume, and your proficiency with more common remote working tools like Jira, Hubspot, Asana, and so on.Get friends, family, and colleagues to proofread it.Nothing says sloppy more than a typo or grammatical error. Get a second, a third, or even a fourth pair of eyes on it before you start sending it to companies.Don’t:Have big blocks of text.Your resume needs to be scannable, with a highlights reel of your key experiences, skills, and the tools you work with. Stick to bullet points and lists—you canelaborate in your tech cover letter.Make it longer than one page.Likewise, anything longer than two pages is at risk of being disregarded for another’s.Make it too design-heavy.For new designers especially, it’s tempting to want the design of the document the star of the show. While a tech resume can certainly include creative elements, above all else it should be easy and quick to read—by both humans and AI software.Remember:If you get through to the interview stage, the hiring manager will use your resume as a reference point for the questions they ask. It’s crucial to highlight skills and experience that you’d be comfortable expanding on in a conversation.To find out more, check out ourguide to the recruiter phone screen.2. Building and formatting a tech resumeNow that we know whatnotto do, we can move on to actually compiling your resume.To make things as clear as possible, we’ll break this section up into two parts: What to include in your tech resume, and how to format a tech resume.What to include in your tech resumeYour resume should include eight key sections:Name and contact information.You don’t need to include an address unless the role you’re applying for is location-specific.Personal summary.This is 1–2 sentences summarizing who you are as a tech professional. This can include your title, the sector you’re currently working in (or are looking to work in), key skills and credentials, and an overview of your experience.Relevant links.Here’s where you link out to your website, portfolio, and any professional networking profiles.Relevant education.Emphasis on the relevant—no one needs to know where you went to elementary school! Stick to highlighting your university education, bootcamp programs, or relevant courses and classes.Tools.As mentioned earlier, highlighting your proficiency in the tools used by the team or company you’re applying for is a great way to boost your chances of getting noticed. If you’re a whiz inFigmaor aGitHubguru—highlight it.Skills.This is arguably the most crucial part of your resume, and what recruiters want to know about in particular. We’ll talk a little more about this in the next section.Work experience.Don’t have any? No problem: If you’re a bootcamp graduate, emphasize the skills you learned on the projects you worked on for your portfolio. You can also highlight work experience in your previous career if it’s relevant for the role.Other cool things about you.Your tech resume doesn’t need to be devoid of your personality; it’s a good chance to tell your potential employers some cool (but relevant) facts. Do you speak other languages, run a blog, or own a business? Include any noteworthy features that make you stand out from the competition.We know what you’re thinking: All that on just one page?Not necessarily. Depending on the role you’re applying for, you can sacrifice one section to place emphasis on another. What’s most important is relevancy.How to format a tech resumeGet the format right.A tech resume is more likely to be well-received if it’s a word document or PDF, but whichever you prefer, make sure it’s presented in the document type required by the uploading tool. Be sure to double-check the job description too, as this often lists a preferred format.Embellish elsewhere.Already noted, but it can’t be overstated: When it comes to tech resume design formats, the simpler and clearer the better. The creativity, storytelling, and design can shine through in your cover letter and portfolio.The differences between them can help shape your approach for each:A tech cover letteris a longer-form document than your resume (but still no longer than a few paragraphs) that introduces yourself as a candidate, expands on your relevant experience, and details your motivations for applying to a specific role.A tech portfolioshowcases your skills in action. It’s a collection of the real-world projects you’ve worked on that demonstrate your competency in your chosen field. Portfolios are usually embellished with videos, images, additional files, and so on.Both of these should be linked to in your resume, and vice versa.Use tools and software to spice it up.There are plenty of tools and software out there that can help you design and format a beautiful tech resume, likeCanva,resume.io, andCakeResume.But keep in mind that over-designed resumes will sometimes be automatically rejected by candidate-tracking AI software. Vibrant colors and branding are great, but don’t get carried away:a UX/UI design resume in particularneeds to be simple, clear, and quickly scannable.We know—it’s tricky to toe the line between a creative resume that showcases your unique personality, and a clear resume that cuts through the fluff to quickly communicate your value.But once you see how it’s done, your life will be a lot simpler: you’ll find some great examples to help you further on.3. How to highlight tech skills on your resumeEmphasizing your tech skills on your resume is vital. Ultimately, it’s these that recruiters are most interested in.There’s definitely a right and wrong way to showcase these. More than simple bullet points suggesting you’re proficient in X skill, recruiters want the proof in the pudding. Provide evidence of how you’ve put said skills into practice.There are also two different types of skills to highlight, hard skills and soft skills.Hard skillsrefer to the technical skills you need to actually perform the role’s basic duties. For aUI designer, this might be wireframing or animation. For aweb developer, this might be documentation or specific coding languages. For adigital marketer, this might be tracking and reporting campaign metrics using a CMS.Soft skillsrefer to the interpersonal skills that make someone a great employee, such as effective communication, project management, leadership skills, and so on. While the word “soft” might suggest these skills are not as important to tech recruiters—many of these soft skills are actually in incredibly high demand. Your ability to be a great team player or manager could be the difference between getting an interview and being overlooked.So you’ll want to highlight both your hard and soft skills—especially if you’re a career changer on the hunt for your first tech role. Thetransferable skillsyou’ve picked up from your previous careers will help you stand out among more experienced candidates.Here are a few best practices for highlighting tech skills on your resume:Quality over quantity.An endless laundry list of everything you can do isn’t going to get you noticed. It’s better to focus on a few key skills that are directly relevant to the role you’re applying for.Use the right language. Mirror the language used in the job description. Where possible avoid repetition of generic terms like “experience with” or “proficient in”.Provide relevant examples. It’s one thing to say you’re good at something, but employers want to know how you’ve put it into practice. Definite bonus points for real-world projects!4. Tech resume examplesNow that we know the elements that form an awesome tech resume, we’ll take a look at some people who got it right.Here are tech resume examples for five of the most popular tech jobs:Data analyst resume exampleViaBeamjobsWhat works?A clear, simple overview of everything a recruiter needs to know, in grayscale—meaning it’s far more likely to be accepted by resume-scanning AI.A career progression, which gives us some insight into Derek’s career goals and motivations as an entry-level data analyst.Specific projects that showcase Derek’s skills in action, with metrics demonstrating the impact of the work he did.To learn more, check out ourguide to writing a great data analyst resume.Web developer resume exampleViaResumeKraftWhat works?A creative way to display key skills and competencies, with bars and dots to break up the text.Richard chose a bullet-pointed summary for added scannability—a great move.The theme is bright and colorful, while still being clear and simple.

There’s a pop of color and a unique logo that showcases creative flair, but it doesn’t take away from the key pieces of information.Winona’s personality shines through in the “ask me about” section, but Winona has prioritized information—so it doesn’t sit above skills, tools, or education.UI designer resume exampleViaMockplusWhat works?This sleek, professional tech resume by Michelle Flacks is simple enough to pass through any AI software, but the effort that’s gone into the design is still clear.

The job responsibilities align perfectly with your experience, the company culture is a good fit, and the benefits are very attractive. You quickly upload your resume and hit “submit,” convinced that you’re clearly the ideal person for the job.But you never hear back, except for acourtesy emailthat says your application was successfully submitted, and you can’t figure out what you did wrong. Unfortunately, even the most qualified job seekers don’t make the cut because their tech resumes fail to make it past the preliminary steps of the hiring process.In the fast-paced tech industry, hiring managers and recruiters are looking for candidates who not only have the required skills and experience but alsostand out from the crowd.Although tech resumes aren’t so different from “traditional” resumes, learning industry-specific best practices will boost your chances of landing your dream tech job.1. Prioritize your resume sections strategicallyCrafting a professional resume isn’t just about filling in the blanks of a template. It’s about strategically organizing your information to highlight your strongest qualifications. With recruiters spending an average ofjust 7 seconds scanning each resume, it’s crucial to catch their attention quickly. The key is to put the most relevant sections at the top to ensure your most compelling qualifications aren’t missed.The optimal order of resume sections can vary depending on your career stage and the roles you’re applying to. For instance, recent graduates and entry-level candidates might want to place their education section before their work experience. However, seasoned professionals would typically do the opposite. This strategy lets you present your strongest points first, whether that’s your academic background or your professional experience.A good rule of thumb for tech roles is to place your career summary and skills section at the top. This immediately showcases your expertise and suitability for the position.If you’re a new graduate or changing careers, consider highlighting relevant coursework to demonstrate your knowledge and commitment to your field. Remember, the goal is to make your resume a compelling narrative of your qualifications, tailored to your desired role.Above is an example of a resume from a candidate who recently graduated with a chemical engineering degree. Notice how their work experience does not apply to their goal of working as an engineer. So instead of starting with their work experience, as many resume templates tend to do, they list their skills and projects first, which are much more relevant to engineering roles.2. Optimize your resume with keywordsWith the rise ofapplicant tracking systems (ATS), the rules of the resume game have changed. These systems scan resumes for specific keywords related to the job — if yourresume includesthese keywords, you’re more likely to pass the ATS and get your resume in front of a human recruiter.“The first thing that happens once you hit submit on a job application containing your resume is through an applicant tracking system. It’s entirely keyword-based, so the ATS will say a resume has X percentage match to the job description.” —Jonny Scharer, a resume expert and career mentor atPathriseStart by identifying several job listings for your target job title. Then upload your resume to a free ATS tool likeJobalyticsor Jobscan and compare it to these job descriptions.At Pathrise, we recommendaiming for your resume to match 45% to 65% of the job description— high enough to meet the threshold for potential employers without requiring you to spend too much time customizing your resume for every job application.To further optimize your resumewith keywords, incorporate relevant words and phrases throughout your resume, such as in your work or project experience, skills section, and career summary.Consider breaking up your skills section into different categories, especially for types of software like libraries, frameworks, databases, or coding languages. This tactic accounts for applicant tracking systems that consider this kind of breakdown while making it easier for human readers to understand the breadth of your knowledge.However, remember to avoid keyword stuffing. “Think of your resume as a conversation — you want people and application tracking systems to listen to the voice of your resume,” Jonny suggests. “Your voice can get louder by increasing the number of keywords, but you can also decrease the amount of ‘noise’ by omitting irrelevant projects or work experience.”Another tactic is to add a variant of a skills section where you describe what you’ll do in a specific role at that company. Below is an example from a software engineer’s resume:See how this candidate adds even more relevant keywords in this section, even for skills they don’t have yet, like leveraging a company’s current CICD pipeline. On top of giving them an edge over other applicants, this detail shows hiring managers that this candidate has clearly thought through how they will grow in the role.Adding industry buzzwords and keywords to your resume helps you get past the automated screening tools and increases your interview chances and hireability rate by 29%.3. Focus on impact and quantificationOther candidates will likely have similar experience and skills, if not identical job responsibilities, throughout their work history. Quantifying your achievements will set you apart from the competition while clarifying exactly how you will add value to the company.“At the end of the day, that’s what people are really concerned about: can you do the job? What results have you historically driven? Can you prove that you can do that for my company?” says Jonny. This shows recruiters not just what you did but the impact of what you did.A simple formula to keep in mind is “Accomplished X to achieve Y as measured by Z.” For instance, instead of saying “improved website performance,” you could say “improved website load times by 30%,” which gives a clearer picture of your impact.Let’s look at another resume sample, which closely follows the formula above:Compare “Provided the client with weekly reports and analysis of caseload inventory that helped management increase efficiency and decreased outstanding tasks by 53%” with the much more generic “Conducted weekly reports and analysis of caseload inventory.” The first version is much more specific and demonstrates exactly how this candidate’s work impacted the organization. This also helps hiring managers imagine how they will contribute to the company.Using concrete numbers to explain how you made an impact helps hiring managers set you apart from other candidates. It will increase your chances of interview and hireability by +40%.4. Use strong action verbsTo compete with other candidates, you need to get specific about what skills and experience you bring to the table. This is where strong action verbs come into play. These powerful words can paint a vivid picture of your abilities, showing that you take initiative and are proactive.Start by looking at the job description and identifying any particular action verbs. Then incorporate them into your resume to upgrade your bullet points. This will also help you avoid repetition as you describe your achievements in similar fields.As you revise your resume, think about the story you’re telling. Are you simply listing tasks, or are you demonstrating how you added value to your previous roles?For instance, instead of using a common verb like “assisted,” consider using more dynamic verbs like “spearheaded,” “directed,” or “initiated.” Similarly, “communicated” could be replaced with “consulted,” “reconciled,” or “collaborated.” You can find more ideas for strong action verbshere.The example above shows how strong action verbsmake a resume more specific and compelling. “Managed sales territory that grew from $2,600 in total sales to $1.6M in 2021” would be a solid description of one of this candidate’s accomplishments, but it fails to highlight how they did it and why it’s impressive.In comparison, “Established first footprint in new territory” makes it clear that the candidate was proactive in their job and succeeded despite the challenge of launching any long-term project from the beginning.Did you know mentioning “Team player” or “team work” more than once or twice has an impact on your hireability? It lowers your chances of interview and hireability by 51%. As it leads to confusion about the duties and work ‘you’ actually performed.5. Leverage your resume header and career summaryThe header and career summary are often the first things a recruiter sees when they look at your resume. By including relevant keywords and information in these sections, you can immediately show that you’re a strong match for the job.The easiest way to implement this is to include a specific title or role you’re targeting — for example, “Web Developer” or “Data Scientist” — in your header. This can immediately show recruiters that you’re a fit for the role.But don’t stop there. Your career summary is another opportunity to further showcase why you’re the best fit for the role. Jonny suggests a simple formula — say four things in four sentences:Who you are:Start with your job title and a brief description of your qualifications, such as “Proven full-stack front-end developer with 10+ years of experience creating responsive, dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript React.”Your proof:Describe a recent project where you put those tech skills into practice to back up your claims. Link to your portfolio or Github so recruiters can find out more without having to look for it.Where you got these skills:Mention the degree, certification, or bootcamp where you learned how to do this job. This detail provides context and shows that you’ve invested time into honing your craft.What your career goals are:Briefly explain what you’re looking for in your next role by combining hard skills and soft skills, like “Eager to join a detail-oriented, passionate team whose ultimate goal is the satisfaction of the end user.”Below is an example of a career summary that follows this formula:Notice how this candidate implemented the other best practices we discussed, like adding relevant keywords and quantifying their experience. Rather than having to scroll through the document to get these details, hiring managers get a highlight reel within the first few seconds of skimming the resume.For job seekers applying to executive roles, consider replacing the career summary with career highlights. This can be a powerful way to showcase the significant impacts you’ve made in your career. For example, you might highlight that you’ve “generated $500M in business over 20 years” rather than describing your career goals.6. List the tools used with every experiencePractical skills are highly valued in the tech industry, especially in startup environments where employers often expect new hires to hit the ground running. Adding the tools you used in a specific job, internship, or project provides vital context about your proficiency in these areas. Plus, it proves that you have hands-on experience, not just theoretical knowledge, of the skills they’re looking for.Mention specific technical skills — like programming languages, software, or methodologies — in the bullet points of your work and project experience sections. For example, if you list Python or SQL as a tool used in a data analysis role, it’s clear that you were doing some level of programming in that job.Looking closely at the software engineering resume above, we can see that this candidate included specific technical skills throughout their work experience. For instance, “Created a real estate website with scalability in mind that utilized Javascript with React Frameworks” says much more about this person’s mastery of this programming language than only listing Java in their skills section.It’s important to note that the tech industry evolves quickly, and new tools are constantly being introduced. Make sure toregularly update your resume to include any new toolsyou’ve learned to use to show that you can keep up with changes in your field.Make your tech resume shine with PathriseIf you’re applying to a huge volume of roles every week, you probably don’t have the time to tailor your resume to each position, so you need to start with a winning resume as your foundation.

Listing yourskillsis not the only thing that matters—choosing theright formatandsectionsis equally crucial. Here are some tips for writing a resume from scratch:1. Don’t try to cram every skill and work experience onto your resumeThink of your resume not as a comprehensive list of your career history, but as a marketing document selling you as the perfect person for the role you’re applying to. For each resume you send out, you’ll want to highlight only the accomplishments and skills that are most relevant to the job at hand (even if that means you don’t include all of yourexperience).This is calledtailoring your resumeand it helps anyone who reads it see exactly why you’re a match for a specific position.2. But keep a resume outline with a full list of your qualificationsSince you’ll be swapping different information in and out depending on the job you’re applying to, save aresume outline—or maybe ourresume worksheet—on your computer with old positions, bullet points tailored for different applications, and special projects that only sometimes make sense to include. Think of this as your brag file. Then, when you’re crafting each resume, it’s just a matter of cutting and pasting relevant information together.3. Ditch the objective statementThe only time anobjective sectionmakes sense is when you’re making a huge career change and need to explain from the get-go why your experience doesn’t match up with the position you’re applying to. In every other case, resume objectives just make you look old-fashioned or out of touch.Read More:3 Reasons You Should Ditch That Resume Objective—and 3 Things You Can Do Instead4. Put the best, most relevant information firstIn journalism speak, “above the fold” refers to what you see on the front half of a folded newspaper (or, in the digital age, before you scroll down on a website)—basically it’s your first impression of a document. In resume speak, it means you should make sure your most relevant qualifications are visible on the top third of your resume.This top section is what thehiring manageris going to see first—and what will serve as a hook for someone to keep on reading. If your most recent position isn’t the most relevant piece of your candidacy, consider leading with a skills section (such as in acombination resume format) or writing aresume summary.5. Choose the right resume format for youThere are lots of different ways to organize the information on your resume—like thefunctional resumeor combination resume. But the good oldreverse chronological—where your most recent experience is listed first—is usually your best bet. Unless it’s absolutely necessary in your situation, skip the functional or skills-based resume—hiring managers might wonder what you’re hiding.6. Keep it conciseThe two-page resume is a hotly debated topic, but the bottom line is this—you want the information here to be as short as possible, and keeping it to one page forces you to prioritize what really matters. If you truly have enough relevant and important experience, training, and credentials to showcase on more than one page of your resume, then go for two. But if you can tell the same story in less space? Do it.Read More:6 Pro Tips for Cutting Your Resume Down to One Page7. Include relevant linksCan’t figure out how to tell your whole story on one page, or want to be able to include some visual examples of your work? Instead of trying to have your resume cover everything, cover the most important details on that document. Then, include a link to yourpersonal website, youronline portfolio, examples of your work, or a relevant,professional social media profile, where you can dive more into what makes you the ideal candidate.Just avoid hyperlinking over words that are key to understanding your resume, since it can throw off the tools employers use to store and parse resumes.8. Be aware of the ATSYou may have heard that employers are using computers to “read” your resume and decide who to hire and reject. That’s not exactly true. But most employers do use software called an applicant tracking system—or ATS—to parse resumes and organize them so that recruiters and hiring managers can search for the most relevant applications.You should assume your resume will pass through an ATS at some point during your job search, so understanding how it works will help make your hunt more efficient. (All of the tips for resume writing in this list keep ATSs in mind as well!)Read More:Beat the Robots: How to Get Your Resume Past the System and Into Human HandsResume formatting tipsYour resume\\'s format matters as much as the content it holds. Aim for a simple and minimalist layout, without overwhelming columns, colors, or graphic elements. Here are some key resume formatting tips to help you stand out:9. Keep your resume format simpleWe’ll talk about getting creative in order to stand out in a minute. But the most basic principle of good resume formatting and design? Keep it simple. Make your resume easy on hiring managers’ eyes by using a reasonably sized default font like Helvetica or Arial and leaving a healthy amount ofwhite spaceon the page. Your main focus here should be on readability for the hiring manager (and that pesky ATS).Read more:The Best Resume Font and Size (No More Agonizing!)10. Stand out with ATS-friendly design elementsReally want your resume to stand out from the sea of Times New Roman? Yes,creative resumes—like infographics, videos, or presentations can set you apart, but you have to make sure they actually get read. If you’re uploading your resume to a job application site or online portal, use ATS-friendly formatting elements like:Bold and italic textUnderlining (in headings or over hyperlinks)ColorsBulletsDifferent text alignmentsColumns that can be read straight across11. Avoid design elements that can’t be “read” by computersOn the flip side, it’s best to avoid design elements that ATSs are known to have trouble with such as:TablesText boxesLogos and iconsImages and photosGraphics, graphs, or other visualsHeaders and footersLess common fontsColumns that can only be read from top to bottom12. Make your contact info prominentYou don’t need to include youraddress on your resumeanymore (really!), but you do need to make sure to include a phone number and professional-sounding email address (but not one affiliated with another job!) as well as other places the hiring manager can find you on the web, like your LinkedIn profile, plus yourpronounsif you’d like to.Read More:Here\\'s Exactly What Should Be Included in Your Resume\\'s Header13. Design your resume for skimmabilityYou’ve probably heard before that hiring managers don’t spend a lot of time on each individual resume. So help them get as much information as possible in as little time as possible, by making yourresume easy to skim.Work experience resume tipsRecruiters nowadays want to know more than a simple description of your responsibilities. They\\'re looking for the results and impacts of your work, as well as the connection between your experience and the position you\\'re applying for now.That said, let\\'s take a look at some resume writing tips for describing your work experience:14. Keep your work experience recent and relevantAs a rule, you should only show the most recent10-15 years of your careerand only include the experiences that are relevant to the positions you’re applying to. Remember to allocate real estate on your resume according to importance. If there’s a choice between including one more college internship or going into more detail about your current role, always choose the latter (unless the internship was more relevant to the role you’re applying for).15. Don’t forget your transferable skills and experiencesDon’t panic if you don’t have any professional experience that fits the bill. Focus your resume on your relevant andtransferable skillsalong with any related side or academicprojects, and then make sure to pair it with a strongcover lettertelling the narrative of why you’re ideal for the job.Read more:What to Put on Your Resume When You Have No Relevant Work Experience16. Write strong, achievement-focused bullet pointsThe bullet points under each job entry are arguably the most important part of your resume. They tell whoever’s reading it what skills you have, how you’ve used them, and how you’ve helped your employers in the past.So start with a strongaction verb, include relevant skills from thejob description, and frame your bullets around your achievements—don’t just list yourjob duties. Tell them how your work benefitted your boss or company so they know what they stand to gain by hiring you.Here’s a simple formula to follow:Compelling verb + job duty + key skills used = tangible resultSo you might say: “Developed an upgrade to the employee database, ensuring the smooth flow of critical operations, which led to a 35% increase in efficiency.”17. Curate your bullet points and experiencesNo matter how long you’ve been in a job, or how much you’ve accomplished there, you shouldn’t have more than eight bullet points under it—and that’s only for your most recent and relevant job. Jobs further back should generally be limited to four to six bullets.Read More:How Many Bullet Points Should Each Job on Your Resume Have?18. Use as many numbers as you canUse facts, figures, and numbers whenever possible in your bullet points. How many people were impacted by your work? By what percentage did you exceed your goals? Quantifying your accomplishments allows the hiring manager to picture the level of work or responsibility you needed to achieve them.19. Don’t neglect non-traditional workThere’s no law that says you can only put full-time or paid work on your resume. So, if you’vevolunteered, worked part-time or asa temporary or contract worker, freelanced, or interned? Absolutely list these things as their own “jobs” within your career chronology—as long as they’re relevant to the job you’re applying for. The same goes forcareer breaks. Yes, really.Read More:4 Things You Didn\\'t Know You Could Put on Your Resume20. Use important keywords from the job descriptionScan the job description, see what words are used most often, and make sure you’ve included them in your bullet points. For example, does the job description list “CRM” or “Salesforce”? Make sure your resume matches. Not only is this a self-check that you’re targeting your resume to the job, but it’ll also make it easier to search for your resume in an ATS.Read More:How to Pick Resume Keywords That\\'ll Get Your Job Application Past the ATSResume tips for including your educationMost hiring managers will want to know your education level, even if it\\'s not necessarily relevant to the position you\\'re going for. This section is especially important for those changing careers or applying for entry-level jobs—as your education can be an indicator of the skills you have.Here\\'s some resume tips and tricks for this section:21. Put experience first, education laterUnless you’re arecent graduate, put your education after your experience. Chances are, your last couple of jobs are more important and relevant to you getting the job than where you went to college.22. Also keep it in reverse chronological orderGenerally, you should list your educational background with the most recent or advanced degree first, working in reverse chronological order. But if older coursework is more specific to the job, list that first to grab the reviewer’s attention.23. Remove the dates from your education section once you’re a few years into your careerUnless you’re early in your career, don’t list your graduation dates. The reviewer cares more about whether or not you have the degree than when you earned it. And you don’t want to inadvertently open yourself up toage discrimination, which is an unfortunate reality in some job markets.24. Highlight honors and achievements, not GPAIf you graduated from college with high honors, absolutely make note of it. Showcase that summa cum laude status, the fact that you were in the honors college at your university, a relevant project you completed, or an award you won. You don’t need to list yourGPA—employers don’t care as much about GPA as they do what skills you gained in school.Read More:How to (and How Not to) List Education on Your Resume25. Include continuing or online educationFeel free to include continuing education, professional development coursework, oronline coursesin your education section, especially if your resume feels a little light on relevant experience.Best resume tips for showing off your skillsYou shouldn\\'t wait until you get aninterviewto showcase your skills—your resume can and should have a specific section for them. You can also leverage other sections of the document to incorporate what\\'s relevant for the position.Here are our tips for making a resume that effectively highlights your skills:26. Don’t forget your skills sectionBe sure to add a section that lists all the relevant skills you have for a position—especially those mentioned in the job description. Includetechnical skillslike software and project management tools or specific knowledge of how to perform relevant tasks. Just make sure to skip including skills that everyone is expected to have, like using email or Microsoft Word. Doing so will make you seemlesstechnologically savvy.27. But don’t only put your skills in your skills sectionYour skills section is an easy way for anyone reading your resume to confirm that you have required qualifications, but that shouldn’t be the only place that your important skills appear. Any skill that’s vital to you being hired should also be in your bullet points—where you can show how you’ve used it in the past.28. Divvy up your skills for readabilityIf you have lots of skills that would help you with a job but aren’t necessarily in the same category—say, foreign language, software, and leadership skills—try breaking up your skills sections. Below your “Skills” section, add a subsection titled “Language Skills” or “Software Skills,” for example. Again, we’re going for skimmability here!29. Show—don’t tell—your soft skillsDescribingsoft skillson a resume often starts to sound like a list of meaningless buzzwords. But being a “strong leader” or an “effective communicator” are important characteristics you want to get across. Think about how you can demonstrate these attributes in your bullet points without actually saying them.Read more:The Non-Boring Way to Show Off Your Soft Skills in Your Job SearchOther resume section tipsResume sections are not fixed like stone-written texts; they can change according to the job position you\\'re applying for or the requirements listed by the company. Here are some examples of sections you can add—and more tips on writing a resume that stand out:30. Include relevant certifications and licensesIf you have acertification or licensethat proves you can do some aspect of the job you’re applying for, include it on your resume. This is especially important if that certification or license is legally required to do the job—for example, in nursing, teaching, or driving jobs.31. Show some (relevant) personalityFeel free to include an “Interests” section on your resume, but only add those that are relevant to the job. Are you a guitar player with your eye on a music company? Definitely include it. But if you’re considering including your scrapbooking hobby for a software developer job at a healthcare company? Best to leave it out.32. Beware of interests and activities that could be controversialMaybe you help raise money for your church on the reg. Or perhaps you’re dedicated to canvassing during political campaigns. Yes, these experiences show a good amount of work ethic or possibly other relevant skills—but they could also open you up to be discriminated against by someone who disagrees with the cause. So weigh your decision to include them carefully.33. Add awards and achievements—when they’re relevantDo include awards and accolades you’ve received, even if they’re company-specific awards. Just state what you earned them for, e.g., “Earned Golden Salesperson Award for having the company’s top sales record four quarters in a row.” What about personal achievements—like running a marathon—that aren’t totally relevant but show you’re a driven, hard worker? Consider thebest way to include them(and if you should).Resume tips for navigating employment gaps and other sticky situationsIf you\\'re an experienced professional, you might have some tricky information to explain. Job hopping, career gap, and short term jobs are examples of things that can make an applicant feel insecure when drafting resumes.Is that your situation? Check on these good resume tips to explain sticky situations without jeopardizing your chances to get an interview:34. Cut the short-term jobsIf you stayed at a (non-temporary) job for only a matter of months, consider eliminating it from your resume to avoid looking like a job hopper. Leaving a particularly short-lived job or two off your resume shouldn’t hurt, as long as you’re honest about your experience if asked in an interview. But if the short-term job is super relevant to this job, consider including it anyway.35. If you have shorter gaps, be strategic about how you list datesIf you have gaps of a few months in your work history, don’t list the usual start and end dates with months and years for each position. Use years only (2018–2020), or just the number of years or months you worked at each position. Just keep it consistent throughout your resume and don’t lie if asked about gaps during an interview.Read more:How to Explain the Gap in Your Resume With Ease36. Explain serial job hoppingIf you’ve job-hopped frequently, you can include a succinct reason for leaving next to each position like “company closed,” “layoff due to downsizing,” or “relocated to a new city.” By addressing the gaps, you’ll proactively illustrate the reason for your frequent job movement and make it less of an issue.37. Explain a long break in jobsRe-entering the workforce after a long hiatus? This is the perfect opportunity for a summary statement at the top, outlining your best skills and accomplishments. Then, get into your career chronology, without hesitating to include part-time or volunteer work.38. Be intentional about career gapsWhile career gaps are becoming increasingly common, you should still frame them in a way that’s relevant to a future employer, by talking about skills you gained or any professional endeavors you took on. If you didn’t focus on professional development, that’s fine too! But not every employer will appreciate it if you get too cutesy about that section of your resume.For example, if you took time out of the workforce to raise kids, you might not want to creatively describe this parenting experience on your resume, à la “adeptly managed the growing pile of laundry.” Instead state what you did plainly and include any professional skills you may have grown or activities you may have done.Read More:Stay-at-Home Parent? How to Kill it on Your Comeback ResumeTips on resume finishing touchesWriting a good resume alone isn\\'t the only thing that matters. How you save and send it can also determine whether the recruiter will even take a look at it. To wrap things up, here are our resume formatting tips and other suggestions to boost your chances of getting noticed:39. Ditch “References available upon request”If a hiring manager is interested in you, they’ll ask you for references—and will assume that you have them. There’s no need to address the obvious (and doing so might even make you look a little out of touch!).40. Proofread, proofread, proofreadIt should go without saying, but fully edit your resume and make sure it’s free and clear of typos. And don’t rely on spell check and grammar check alone—step away for a few hours, then read your resume closely again, and ask family or friends to take a look at it for you.41. Save it as a PDF or Word documentUnless a job posting specifically requests that you do otherwise, your resume should always be submitted as either aPDF or Word document(.docx not .doc). These are the formats that can be most easily opened and most easily parsed by an ATS.The choice between the two is up to you (again, unless the company you’re applying to requests one format over the other). If you’re emailing your resume, however, PDFs are a bit more likely to maintain your formatting across different computers and programs.42. Name your file clearlyReady to save your resume and send it off? Save it as “Jane Smith Resume” instead of “Resume.” The hiring manager is going to have plenty of “Resumes” on their computer, so make it super easy for them to find what they’re looking for. You can even go a bit further and put the position title in your file name (e.g., “Jane Smith Marketing Analyst Resume).Read More:The (Simple) Guidelines You Should Follow When Naming Your Resume and Cover Letter Files43. Keep your resume outline freshCarve out some time every quarter or so to pull up your resume outline and make some updates. Have you taken on new responsibilities? Learned new skills? Add them. When your resume is updated on a regular basis, you’re always ready to pounce when opportunity presents itself. And even if you’re not job searching, there areplenty of good reasonsto keep this document in tip-top shape.The Muse LogoA logo with \"the muse\" in white text.© 2024 Daily Muse Inc.About The MuseAbout UsCareersFAQsContact UsSearch JobsBrowse CompaniesTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyPopular JobsNew York JobsSan Francisco JobsSeattle JobsEngineering JobsMarketing JobsInformation Technology JobsSalariesSearch Job TitlesGet InvolvedFor EmployersFor PartnersThe Muse Book: The New Rules of WorkPodcast: The New Rules of WorkFor Career CoachesSend Feedback About The MuseTell A FriendJoin The ConversationFacebookLinkedInTwitterPinterestInstagram', '70 Accomplishments to Add to Your Resume—and How | The MuseSkip to main contentThe Muse LogoA logo with &quat;the muse&quat; in dark blue text.JobsAccount ManagementAccounting and FinanceAdministration and OfficeAdvertising and MarketingArtsBusiness OperationsComputer and ITCustomer ServiceData and AnalyticsDesign and UXEducationHealthcareHuman Resources and RecruitmentManagementMedia, PR, and CommunicationsProduct ManagementProject ManagementSalesSoftware EngineeringWriting and EditingView All JobsCompaniesAdviceCoachingEmployersSign InSaved CompaniesAccount SettingsSign OutJob SearchFinding a JobResumesResume ExamplesCover LettersNetworkingInterviewingJob OfferView all in Job Search >Career PathsExploring CareersCareers in Data and AnalyticsCareers in FinanceCareers in MarketingCareers in SalesCareers in Software EngineeringCareer StoriesCareer ChangeTraining and DevelopmentView all in Career Paths >Succeeding at WorkWork and COVID-19ProductivityGetting AheadWork RelationshipsWork-Life BalanceWorking ParentsRemote WorkMoneyChanging JobsManagementBreak RoomView all in Succeeding at Work >Diversity and InclusionAnti-Racism at WorkLGBTQ at WorkDisability and WorkGender and WorkView all in Diversity and Inclusion >MoreVideosJob Search VideosCareer Advice VideosCareer Story VideosCompany Spotlight VideosIndustry Spotlight VideosEmployer ResourcesAdvice/Job Search/ResumesForget Job Duties—Add Accomplishments to Your Resume to Land the JobbyRegina BorsellinoUpdated3/1/2023FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailBailey Zelena; fizkes/Getty ImagesPut yourself in the shoes of someone looking for a new office manager for a second.

It tells you not only what that person has done, but also how well they’ve done it and what kinds of tools they’re familiar with.So why the hell are you still listing your job duties? Here’s how to list your accomplishments on a resume instead in a way that’ll show off what you can really do—plus examples!Why you should include achievements and accomplishments on your resumeWhen you apply to a job, chances are you’re not the only applicant who’s qualified. You’re not the only applicant with experiences and skills that match what the job description is looking for. But your professional accomplishments and achievements—with all their details and results—are yours alone. They tell hiring managers: “Here’s what I’ve done for my past employers. Imagine what I could do for you.”Where you can list accomplishments on a resumeThe vast majority of your achievements will be in yourexperience section, under your past jobs, but you can also highlight\\xa0impressive,relevantaccomplishments in other sections such as your:Resume summaryEducation section(especially if you’re early in your career)Volunteerandactivities sectionsAwards sectionProjects sectionHow to include accomplishments on your resumeSo you’ve decided to swap those boring job duties for your professional accomplishments from your past roles. Here’s how to do it:1. Choose the right accomplishments.Take a look at thejob descriptionfor the position you’re applying to. Make a note of any skills or experiences you have that line up with the required or preferred qualifications or the job duties you’d be responsible for. Then, think about which accomplishments best exemplify these skills and experiences.If you’re struggling, start by thinking about your major responsibilities. What were your goals? If you were responsible for managing a social media account, were you supposed to schedule a certain number of posts? Grow the follower count? Meeting one or more of these goals is an accomplishment—and exceeding them certainly is!2. Use strong action verbs.Traditionally, resume bullet points start with verbs.\\xa0 Choosingstrong, descriptive action verbs(in your bullet points and throughout your resume)\\xa0will\\xa0tell the reader more about your accomplishment—did youcreatea new process? Or did youstreamlineone? And don’t forget to\\xa0change them up so the first word of every line isn’t the same!3.Include theskillsand tools you used.Don\\'t forget to actuallysaywhatskillsyou’re trying to emphasize with each achievement—preferably using the same phrasing as the job description. If the posting specifically mentioned Salesforce experience as a requirement, for example, make sure you explicitly state that you used Salesforce to schedule all those meetings in your last job!4. Don’t forget the results.Even painting the most cinematic picture of everything you did and the hard work you put in can still leave a hiring manager or recruiter thinking, “So what?” That is, if you don’t include how your accomplishment helped your team, department, company, or clients.Remember, anyone looking at your resume wants to know what you can do for them—so show them what you’ve done for others. Did you save or make money? Increase efficiency? Grow reach or visibility?5. Add numbers.Whenever possible, you want toquantify your accomplishments, or add numbers to give them scale. If you work with numbers directly, this might be self-explanatory. But even if you don’t, you can add numbers to your achievements by mentioning:Time frames and frequencies for the tasks you’re describingThe number of times you did something or the amount of work products you handledMoney saved, earned, or managedThe number of employees, clients, or other stakeholders you managed, coordinated, or helpedPercent growth you saw and percentages of goals and KPIs you hitAudience sizeIf you don’t know the exact numbers or they varied over time, you can list a range (from three to six employees), an approximation (~$100,000), or a minimum (over 50 clients).70 example accomplishments for your resumeHere are some example achievements that you can use to inspire your resume:Entry-level job accomplishment examplesIf you’re writing a resume for an entry-level job or yourfirst jobever, you’re more likely to use accomplishments from your education and extracurricular activities.

Before you axe your resume skills section to make more space, read on to get the full picture of what you’d be giving up. And once you’re convinced not to scrap it, find out what types of skills you should include on a resume, how you should format a dedicated skills section, and how to figure the right skills for each job application.Why do I need a skills section?Overall, your resume skills section gives your application a nice optimization bump for both the human and digital review process. The whole point of keeping your resume concise is to allow a recruiter or hiring manager to figure out the value you could create for the company after just a quick skim.For certain roles, it can be a nonstarter for a candidate to not have specific skills. You can’t be a ballerina if you don’t know how to dance, obviously, just like you won’t get a front-end developer role if you don’t know HTML.Outside of these situations, however, the hiring managers I’ve spoken to are looking at the big picture. Monica Orta, a hiring manager at the MIT Media Lab, says the skills section gives her “a sense of the suite of skills a person has—it’s another way to look at their experience and helps paint a fuller picture.” They’re trying to connect the dots, and skills help fill in the gaps a bit.Another reality of the job application process is the ubiquity ofapplicant tracking systems (ATS)—software that most employers use to organize and parse candidate resumes. Keyword scanning is one way an ATS flags resumes for closer review, and a skills section, conveniently, can serve as an extra block of relevant keywords.What do I include in my skills section?Hiring managers are trying to pull together a story about you, so the first rule is that your skills section should match the experience you’ve written about in your resume.Here’s what you should include:Skills relevant tothisjobEach job will require different skills to be successful, so each skills section you write will be a bit different as well. But how do you figure out the right combination of skills for a particular job application? Check the answer key!That is, print out the job description of the role you’re interested in and take a highlighter to it (or copy and paste it into a doc and highlight there), marking any skills you see listed that you have. Then, make sure these skills are listed on your resume. For example, here’s a job description with some of the key skills bolded:Email Marketing ManagerResponsibilitiesManage email marketing strategy and calendarMonitor, analyze, and report on campaign performanceImprove campaign success throughconversion optimization, A/B testing, segmentation,and moreCollaborate with the design and editorial teams to maintain consistent brand and voice across platformsWork cross-functionally with sales, product, product marketing, and data teamsRequirements3+ years in email marketingExperience withcontent management systems and email service providers such as MailChimp or Constant ContactExperience withGoogle Analytics, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Microsoft Excel, and SEOa plusExcellent oral and written communication skillsTeam player with strong interpersonal, relationship-building, and stakeholder management skillsExcellent problem solving and time management skillsAnd here’s a list of skills you might include in your skills section if you were applying to the job:Conversion optimization, A/B testing, segmentation, MailChimp, Constant Contact, Google Analytics, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Microsoft Excel, SEOAll of that is just from one job description. Even better, find a few different job postings for the kind of role you’re interested in. Then, start looking for common skills among the different postings. These are the skills you definitely want on your resume—and likely in your skills section.When crafting your skills section, pay particular attention to skills that the employer is looking for, but haven’t necessarily been part of your daily job. Perhaps you took anonline courseon how to use InDesign or independently studied web design and HTML for your personal website. These skills will be absent from your experience section, which means the skills section is a great place to highlight them.Hard skillsYour resume skills section should mainly be reserved for yourhard skills. Think programming languages, business or design software, analytics programs, subject-matter expertise, or even carpentry skills—anything that can be taught, defined, and measured.Hiring managers often considersoft skills(like teamwork, communication, time management, and leadership) to be just as important as hard skills, if not more so. That said, these skills are not often included in a separate skills section since they’re usually intangible and harder to evaluate. While your soft skills are incredibly important, they’re better portrayed (and more believable) if you give them some context. So save your soft skills for resume bullets and your cover letter, where you can tell a story that shows them in action.Read More:Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills: What the Heck Is the Difference?Bonus skills that show your passionYou can also add skills that will show how passionate you are about the job. For example, one hiring manager I know in tech finds it interesting and noteworthy to see skills that are kind of esoteric, but still relevant. Functional programming languages in particular always catch his eye. To him, it indicates that the candidate has a keen interest in programming and possibly went out of their way to learn it on their own. That’s a pretty efficient way to show your enthusiasm—listing a juicy, related, but kind-of-obscure skill.Read More:The Right Way to Add Skills to Your Resume (With 250+ Example Skills)Whatshouldn’tI include in my skills section?Here’s what doesn\\'t belong in your skills section:Irrelevant skills:Particularly for people who are pivoting to another career, it can be a good branding move to not include the skills you don’t want to use anymore, especially if they’re not relevant or inherently interesting. For example, if you’re an executive assistant who wants to move into diversity and inclusion work, you probably don’t want to list all the flight booking and calendaring tools you’re familiar with. If you must include these skills in your experience section to accurately describe your previous roles, that’s fine, but don’t reiterate them in your skills section.Very basic skills:There’s generally no need to put “Microsoft Word” or similar on your resume, unless the job description specifically lists this skill.Skills you don’t have:Listing skills on a resume implies you’re confident in your abilities. So you should also leave off anything that you’re still working on or don’t feel comfortable training someone else in (like foreign languages you haven’t spoken since high school).Unrelated hobbies:You might be an amazing knitter, but that probably doesn’t belong in your skills section if you’re applying to be a social media manager for a hotel chain. (You can always include these kinds ofhobbiesunder “Interests,” of course.)How do I write a skills section?Hopefully, at this point you’ve been convinced to keep your skills section intact and perhaps even to add a couple things you hadn’t thought of before. But how do you best present all this important information in a way that isn’t just a jumble of keywords? That might be okay for an ATS, but no human being wants to read that. So follow these steps:1. Group your skills.Sort your skills into reasonable categories, then name each group of skills something appropriate. Think of subheadings as beautiful things that make even the most unruly mess of words look sleek and organized. For example, if you happen to be multilingual, a good subheading for all the languages you speak would be, unsurprisingly, “Languages.” Or if you’re a designer who also codes, label your sections “Design” and “Technical.”2. Format your skills section so it’s easy to read.For example, you might put each category on a new line with the subheading in bold at the beginning of the list. Even though this section is short, it still needs to be easy to skim. Bullets and subheadings prompt the reader to start reading again.3. Decide where to place your skills section.Generally a skills section lives at the bottom of a resume. It’s meant to reiterate or summarize what the reader learned from your experience section. There are some exceptions though. If you’re a career changer who’s been slowly accumulating the necessary skills for a shift, for example, it might make sense to move this section up to a more prominent spot on your resume—possibly even the top—to create ahybrid,functional, orskills-basedresume. If you work in a technical field where hard skills are paramount, you might also want to put your skills section at the top.Example skills sectionHere’s an example of a good skills section for someone who is looking for work as a designer:SKILLSVisual Design:InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere, XD, Animate, Lightroom3D Modeling & 2D Drafting:Rhino, VRay, AutoCAD, Vectorworks, Autodesk Fusion 360Programming:Grasshopper, Processing, HTML, CSSRegina Borsellinoalso contributed writing, reporting, and/or advice to this article.The Muse LogoA logo with \"the muse\" in white text.© 2024 Daily Muse Inc.About The MuseAbout UsCareersFAQsContact UsSearch JobsBrowse CompaniesTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyPopular JobsNew York JobsSan Francisco JobsSeattle JobsEngineering JobsMarketing JobsInformation Technology JobsSalariesSearch Job TitlesGet InvolvedFor EmployersFor PartnersThe Muse Book: The New Rules of WorkPodcast: The New Rules of WorkFor Career CoachesSend Feedback About The MuseTell A FriendJoin The ConversationFacebookLinkedInTwitterPinterestInstagram', '10 Resume Profile Examples (And How to Write Yours) | The MuseSkip to main contentThe Muse LogoA logo with &quat;the muse&quat; in dark blue text.JobsAccount ManagementAccounting and FinanceAdministration and OfficeAdvertising and MarketingArtsBusiness OperationsComputer and ITCustomer ServiceData and AnalyticsDesign and UXEducationHealthcareHuman Resources and RecruitmentManagementMedia, PR, and CommunicationsProduct ManagementProject ManagementSalesSoftware EngineeringWriting and EditingView All JobsCompaniesAdviceCoachingEmployersSign InSaved CompaniesAccount SettingsSign OutJob SearchFinding a JobResumesResume ExamplesCover LettersNetworkingInterviewingJob OfferView all in Job Search >Career PathsExploring CareersCareers in Data and AnalyticsCareers in FinanceCareers in MarketingCareers in SalesCareers in Software EngineeringCareer StoriesCareer ChangeTraining and DevelopmentView all in Career Paths >Succeeding at WorkWork and COVID-19ProductivityGetting AheadWork RelationshipsWork-Life BalanceWorking ParentsRemote WorkMoneyChanging JobsManagementBreak RoomView all in Succeeding at Work >Diversity and InclusionAnti-Racism at WorkLGBTQ at WorkDisability and WorkGender and WorkView all in Diversity and Inclusion >MoreVideosJob Search VideosCareer Advice VideosCareer Story VideosCompany Spotlight VideosIndustry Spotlight VideosEmployer ResourcesAdvice/Job Search/Resumes10 Resume Profile Examples (And How to Write Yours)byRegina BorsellinoUpdated3/25/2024FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailGetty ImagesImagine you\\'ve got everything covered in yourresume: You listed your past experiences, includedkeywordsfrom the job description, and pared it down to design elements anapplicant tracking system (ATS)can parse.

Curious? Read on to find out exactly what a resume profile is, and how to write yours—including examples.What is a resume profile?A resume profile is a few concise sentences or bullet points that can be placed at the top of your resume (below the header). It “describes who you are as a professional,” says Muse career coachYolanda Owens, founder ofCareerSenseiand who also worked as a college corporate recruiter for more than 20 years.Once you perfect your resume, check outopen jobson The Muse to maximize your chances»Career professionals don’t all agree on the exact contents of a resume profile, or even on whether it’s different from aresume summary. So you have a bit of flexibility in how you think about yours and what you include in it.For example, you might think of a resume profile as a way to “tell the reader who you are, what you do, and what you’re looking for,” so that you can grab their attention and “quickly showcase your accomplishments,” says Muse career coach and former recruiterJennifer Smith, founder ofFlourish Careers.Or you might approach your resume profile like Owens does, as the equivalent to “a dating profile that describes how you see yourself at work, and the type of work environment that makes you feel productive and purposeful.”What’s the difference between a resume summary and a profile?While some career coaches may use the terms resume summary and resume profile interchangeably, others treat them differently.The first is a quick synopsis of the relevant experiences and skills you bring to a role. The latter can do the same, but it can also focus on your traits and achievements, your story as a professional, and your desires for your next role.At this point, you might be wondering: If a resume profile includeswhat you’re looking for in your next role, how is it different from aresume objective? Some people say that resume objectives are outdated at best and a waste of space at worst. If that’s true, why is a resume profile acceptable?The difference lies in “the additional context that’s included in the profile,” says Smith. A traditional objective merely states what you’re looking for and maybe a vague reason why. But “the profile goes deeper into who you are and what you do” in addition to what you’re looking for next, connecting your past and present to your future.Is a resume profile necessary?Who should use it?Resume profiles can be advantageous for all job seekers, Smith says, especially for those “who are changing either their role or industry.” If you’re acareer changer, a strong, explicit resume profile will give you space to tell the reader right up front that, no, you didn’t apply to this job by mistake—this is the next step in your career and here’s why.Resume profiles are also particularly useful for entry-level job seekers who may need to tie their education and other experiences together more explicitly. If a candidate is writing anentry-level resume, Owens suggests that they “use the profile section to explain what they’re looking for in terms of challenges and learning, and the skills they possess that could potentially add value.”What to include in a resume profileThink about what you’d want the person reading your resume to know first. Is it something about your qualifications or your biggest accomplishment? Is it how well you work with others or what your personality adds to a team? This is what should go into your resume profile. You have a few sentences (or bullets) to work with, so don’t restrict yourself to highlighting just one thing.Here are a few types of information that you can include in a resume profile, according to our coaches:Relevant skills and experiencesRelevant achievements and accomplishmentsYears of experienceStrengths as a professional (bothsoftandhard skills)Signature traits related to the jobPersonal traits that contribute to your workQualities you’re looking for in your next role, team, or companyWillingness to relocate (if you’re applying to a job not near thelocationlisted on your resume)What are recruiters looking for in a resume profile?Don’t underestimate the power of a good first impression to get someone to keep reading the rest of your resume with interest. “The resume profile has an ability to quickly convince a recruiter that the person is a strong, qualified candidate,” says recruiter and Muse career coachSteven Davis, founder and CEO ofRenaissance Solutions.But recruiting isn’t just about making sure candidates have the right skills, Owens says. Recruiters also need to get a feel for whether the team and work environment will be a good match for the candidate long term.Candidates’ skills and experiences should be well represented throughout their resumes, so as a recruiter, Owens most often “looked at the profile as a way to get a sense of their work persona and gauge environment fit for the role.”How to write a profile for a resume: 5 stepsOnce you know what recruiters and hiring managers are looking for in your resume profile and what you’d like to portray, you can follow these tips as you write your own:1. Keep it conciseYour resume profile should be no more than four sentences or bullet points, and should not have more than 500 characters. Remember recruiters read dozens of resumes daily, so you don\\'t want yours to be unnecessarily long and tiring.2. Find the format the suits you bestDecide if you want to use either bullet points or paragraph form. Your resume profile can be written as bullet points, but keep in mind that bullet points often take up more space than a paragraph. “To preserve real estate on the resume and attempt to keep it toone to two pages, I always recommend using paragraph format,” Owens says.3. Consider the position you\\'re applying forTailor your profile to the job, but not so much that it’s not true to who you are. If your resume profile is closer to a summary that highlights your key qualifications and accomplishments as they relate to a given job, you should be tailoring it very carefully for each application and incorporating keywords from the job description.Read more:What it Really Means to \"Tailor Your Resume\"However, if your resume profile is more of a personal (but still professionally appropriate) description of yourself, Owens recommends against tailoring it to match each job: “What you don’t want to do is try to tell employers what you think they want to hear,” she says, if it doesn’t reflect who you are. “That’s how you end up in positions where you’re ultimately unhappy.”4. Quantify your experiences and accomplishmentsWhenever possible,quantify your experiences and accomplishmentsby adding numbers, percentages, and other metrics to your resume profile. Keep in mind that recruiters nowadays not only want to know what you did, but also what you achieved and the exact results of your work.5. Show some personalityWhile the rest of your resume won’t let much of your personality shine through, your profile gives you an opportunity for creativity. If you’re applying to a casual company, you can add a splash of personality, but if you’re applying to a more formal organization, it’s best to keep things more buttoned up.Resume profile: ExamplesWant to know what all this advice looks like in action?

educational startups includingspringboard for over a year and becausei've reviewed and edited countlessresumes throughout the mentorship i knowprecisely the common mistakes candidatesoften make trust me on this implementingmy techniques into your resume willsignificantly increase traction from therecruiters that's how i help dozens ofpeople get offers from companies likefang i also have a special announcementregarding springboard including athousand dollar discount if you use thepromo code pirate king but more on thatlater so here ismy resumei created a dark resume because i wantedmine to kind of stand out and because ijustlove dark themes if you only knew thepower of the dark side i don't recommenda dark themed resume if you're anentry-level engineer but for me itworkedi got offers from amazon microsoftgoogle and a few others with this resumepeace alright here are my 10 tips oncrafting an effective softwareengineering resumetip number one people love modesty butthey do not hire it i want you toremember this before we dissect myresume when applying for a job it's notthe time to be humble i'm not asking youto be cocky and arrogant but there's adifference between being confident andmodest show these guys what you're madeof if this isn't the time to presenteverything you've got then when is givethem a reason to choose you over theothers remember you're in a competitionbe aggressive and do not hold yourselfback try your best to make your resumeappear as impressive and impactful aspossible adopt the winning mindset tipnumber two make a strong impression witha single page let me ask you a questiondo you know on average how much timerecruiters spend reviewing a resumeseven seconds that's right you only haveseven seconds to convince them if theyspend seven seconds on your resume willthey ever take a look at your secondpagedo you now see the importance ofincluding only the essential componentson your resume your resume should bewell organized on a single page let merepeat what i found from google withsuch limited time the first impressionyou make is criticaltip number three make it easy to learnabout you let's begin with the headermake sure to include your linkedin thegoal is to force the recruiters tonavigate your profile longer make themcurious give them ways to find moreabout who you are the same goes forgithub if you've worked on personalprojects point them to where source codeis let them know that you are indeed asoftware engineer lastly don't forget toembed links again learning more aboutyou shouldn't be difficulttip number four describe yourself withskills not words i like having skills inthe first section because it's de factoa quick overview of my technicalbackground i'm virtually replacing theprofessional summary with my skillsbecause my techniques translate who i ammuch better than a simple goal oh oneword of advice about skills don't put inobvious stuff like microsoft word excelwindows or mac os and visual studio codeyou're wasting precious space that'slike an uber driver confessing he knowshow to use google mapstip number five make a preemptive strikeone common mistake candidates make intheir resumes is putting education firstdon't do that especially if you'realready active in the field even if yourstudent put experience at the top if youhave any internships or similar rememberyou're not applying to a school you'reapplying to a company what do you thinkis the number one thing that companieslook for your education your gpa no it'salways the work experience of the sevenseconds guess how many you wasted byputting your experience at the bottomtip number six exaggeratelet's dig deeper into experience forexample the first bullet point undermicrosoft led the design and developmentof multiple enterprise levelmicroservice applications driving 35.3billion dollars of revenue every yearfirst of all if i'm honestly the oneresponsible for driving billions ofdollars every year i wouldn't be herethe point is that exaggerating yourimpact is acceptable as long as it's nota lie for instance i did work in thecommerce department at microsoft whichis responsible for selling microsoftproprietary licenses whether direct orindirect i was involved in designing anddeveloping several revenue generatingsystems embellishing is how you addimpact to your work and make it appearmore interesting making up a baselessstory is a deception but adding spicesto your presentation is a tactictip number seven quantify one of thethings companies love is metrics theylove to measure stuff for exampledriving 35.3 billion dollars of revenueat microsoft monthly revenue of 1billion dollars at ebay and increasingglobal revenue by 23 in the firstquarter compared these two sentences andgenerated a lot of revenue with newproduct versus generated 100 milliondollars of revenue with the new producthow about these two reduce the apilatency significantly versus reduce theapi latency by 80 from 10 to 2 secondsdo you see how the latter examples aremuch more convincing and conceivablequantify your bullet points wherever youcan another great thing about this isthat it adds credibility i mean you dohave supporting claims when you makesuch assertions righttip number eight provide the businesscontext the first person to screen yourresume is always a recruiter but guesswhat they don't know anything aboutcoding another critical mistakecandidates make on their resume isbombarding it with technical detailsinstead of just enumerating theprogramming languages and frameworksprovide the business context of youraccomplishments for example what realworld problem did you solve what doesyour system do and what impact did ithave how did your work help the businessflourish remember the recruiters arehumans not machines like usyou need to speak the language that weall can comprehend tip number nine stayrelevant all employers put more emphasison recent work history and not the pastdo you see how my non-full-time jobs ineducation are just one-liners they'reworth noting but i won't elaboratebeyond that because they're lessrelevant the same goes for jobs that arenot soft for engineer related if youworked at a restaurant part-time taughtenglish or something similar make it aone-liner or delete it completelyinstead use the opening to incorporatemore bullet points that can further addvalue to your resume lastly i hate todisappoint you but companies recruitersand hiring managers don't really careabout your non-technical skills orhobbies like playing piano games hikingand speaking multiple languages i'mguilty myself having included beingtrilingual on their skills but hey it'sjust a flex piecebefore we move on to the final tip didyou guys know i worked as a softwareengineering mentor at

      "one of the biggest issues with resumetips from the internet is that most ofit is subjectivewhat works for me might not work for youand vice versaso when austin belsack released hisfindings from analyzing 125484 resumes i got excited becausedata to a large extent takes theguesswork out of the equation in myopinion his findings are pure goldbecause it basically confirmed mysuspicionsthat in order to write an incredibleresume there are someproven foundational principles we shouldfollowwhether we're making a resume for ourfirst job or improving upon a goodresume we've had for yearsas usual i care about your time so i'mgoing to share the five key learnings upfrontthen talk about the implications of thestudy and end with practical resumewriting tips you can use immediately tostand outso let's get started hi friends welcomeback to the channel if you're new heremy name is jeff and we're all aboutpractical career interview andproductivity tips if you're workingprofessional consider subscribing formore actionable contentfull disclosure austin did not ask me tomake this video he doesn't even know whoiam the data geek and me just got soexcited about all the numbers that ijust had to share it in a video formatwithout further ado the five keylearnings from austin's studynumber one resumes with a linkedinprofile see higher interview ratesbut only 48 of resumes included alinkedin profilenumber two candidates only included 51ofimportant keywords and skills heavilyunder indexingon soft skills number three measurablemetrics improve resume outcomes but only26 percent of resumes included five ormoremetrics number four research shows thatthe ideal resume length is 475 to 600words77 of resumes fell outside of that rangeand number five fluffy content takesaway from a resume's valuebut 51 of resumes included buzzwordsclichesor incorrect pronouns i'm gonna link theoriginal article and all other resourcesi mentioned down in the descriptionbelowso feel free to check that out if youwant more perspective on how to writegreat resumes now you know the keytakeawayswhat does this actually mean for youlet's start with number oneincluding a linkedin profile on yourresume and here's a graph thatcompletelyblew me away at first glance theimplication seems to be pretty simplehaving a linkedin profile linked on yourresume gives you a much higher chance oflanding a job interviewbut if you take a closer look having abare bones or basiclinkedin profile actually decreases yourchances of getting a callbackmeaning you're better off hiding yourlinkedin profile if you're not puttingany effortinto it in my opinion the differencesbetween a comprehensive profile and abasic one boiled down to number onehaving a professional headshot andlinkedin banner number twohow informative your work detail sectionis and number threehow much effort you put into buildingmeaningful connectionsi actually have a linkedin tips andtricks playlist that walks you throughall those pointsand also share how to get a customlinkedin url to put on your resume sothat it looks cleanmake sure to check that out after thisvideo and that's not all you might alsonoticethat as job level increased the gap incallback ratesdecreased between job applicants thissuggests that having a strong linkedinprofileis more important for entry level jobseekers compared to their higherlevel peers if you're finding this videohelpful so far please drop a like and ifnotkeep watching because it only getsbetter number twoincluding the right keywords and skillswhen writing a resume or cvwhile i'm not a big fan of justsubmitting applications onlineit is a fact of life that applicanttracking systems scan for certainkeywords and experiencesto filter out what they define as lowpotential candidatesaccording to the research the averagejob description includes 43 keywordsbut most candidates only match 51 ontheir resumemeaning they only included 20 or sorelevantkeywords in order to overcome this youwant to use free online word cloud toolsi'll link a few down below copy andpaste the job descriptionin there and identify the keywords thatpop up most frequentlyand make sure to include those in anatural waywhen writing your resume furthermore wesee that candidates resumes included 60of the necessary hard skills and only 28of the necessary soft skills whencompared to their target rolesjob description this makes sense becausethere's usually a skill slashinterest section at the bottom of yourresume where you highlight yourcapabilities inexcel python sql the hard skills rightto make sure you're also includingrelevant soft skillsyou can take a look at udemy's workplacetrends report or cnbcsummary and see which of the top 10in-demandsoft skills are applicable to you andinclude thoseas well number three include measurableresultsin your bullet points the study showsthat 26 resumes includedfive or more instances of measurablemetrics while 36more than a third didn't include asingle quantifiable resultwhy do companies prefer resumes withmetrics becausemetrics make value easier to understandand quantifyi cannot stress this enough if 10candidates all say they're responsiblefor planning and executing social mediacampaignsit's very hard to tell who did it welland who didn'tthe one person that says hey mycampaigns drove 30year year increase in sales revenue isgonna stand outthere's a popular xyz resume bulletpoint formula that goes like thisaccomplish x as measured by y by doingz for example if you're a contentmarketing manager your bullet pointmight look like thisdrove 2500 organic signups to ourmonthly newsletter by a b testingcontent layout and collaborating withco-marketing partnersrepresenting a 43 quarter on quarterincreasepro tip a lot of you might be working onprojects that might not have a directimpact on growth or revenue let's sayyou're working on your company'sinternal toolsin that case you can say yourimprovements led to a 33increase in productivity for the salesteam whichtranslates to x amount of incrementalrevenue number four keep your resumelength between 475and 600 words a this is because theresearch has shownthat resumes in that sweet spot sawdouble the interviews of those that wereoutside of those rangesb 77 of the resumes from austin's studyhad either fewer than 475 wordsor more than 600 meaning from a purelystatistical standpoint you areautomatically in a stronger positionversus other candidates if you have a500 word resume of coursei do want to point out there aredefinitely exceptions when it comes tocareer leveland academic roles if you're a professorfederal employee or c-level executiveyou might have a 2-3 page resume or cvwith well over 1 500 words and that'sperfectly fine for those of you who donot fall in that category thoughthis finding means that number one donot keyword stuff your resumeit's not about the number of keywordsyou have in your resume right it's abouthaving the onesthat match the job and of course numbertwo something a lot of us have beendoing since middle schoolusing the word count tool in word orgoogle docs to make sure we're stayingwithin that sweet spot and number fivethe bane of all recruiters hiringmanagers and just resume readers ingeneralbuzzwords and cliches do not use themwe're all super motivated by ourpassions we're all detail-oriented teamplayerswe all have creative mindsets and whodoesn't like to talk about the synergiesbetween differentproducts if you found that hard tolisten to imagine the recruiter goingover 30 resumesa day and according to the study 51 ofresumesin the data set included some sort ofbuzzword or clichebuzzwords fluff cliches are unnecessaryand take away from your messageyour writing should always be sellingyour experience not summarizing it as avery practical solutiongo ahead and google resume cliches andbuzzwordsand remove all the ones you find in yourresume to give it aninstant upgrade were some of thefindings from austin study pretty basicyeah you should always includemeasurable results in your bullet pointsoptimize and add your linkedin profileand avoid using buzzwords to write agood resume but hopefullythe numbers behind the research haveconvinced you that these non-negotiableaspects lay very solid groundwork foryou to make additional tweaksand adjustments i've actually made

fun rightnow but you're not you're hanging outwith me so thanks so here's the thingI've designed a system that allows youto make the highest quality resume inthe shortest amount of time you're busyokay you don't have time to spend hoursand hours and hours and days and monthsand years and light years redoing yourresume so I'm not going to waste anymore time blabbering along let's getinto it first of all let's get clearwhat a resume is not a resume is not alist of everything you've ever done inyour life get out of here with thosethree to four page resumes I once saw asix page resume and the last page wasjust blank do we get our rums back or doyou keep them because I only have theone and I have a chili recipe on theback that I really want to keep theamount of resumes I've seen with nonames on them no one is looking at yourlong resume okay we got to keep itconcise one page is preferred two pagesin special circumstances and if you'regoing to make a two-page resume youbetter be sure that nothing important ison that second page because they willmost likely not look at it number two aresume is not an opportunity to showcaseyour personality or design skills theaverage recruiter spends about 7 Secondsjust skimming your resume so the purposeof a resume is to convey the most amountof relevant information in the shortestamount of time and then peopleinevitably say well Aaron I'm working ina creative field shouldn't I showcase mycreativity through my resume no youshouldn't that's what your portfolio isfor every professional graphic designerI know has the most simplistic minimalrume I've ever seen because they areprofessionals and they know that thefunction of a rume is to convey a lot ofinformation in a short amount of time soany distractions from that that hurt thefunction of the resume what did daerROMs the the famous designer say gooddesign is as little design as possiblethat is the mentality we are going tohave now I would be remissed if I didn'ttalk about the infamous ATS ATS standsfor applicant tracking system ATS is anumbrella name for a lot of differentsoftwares that companies use to siftthrough and organize applicants so whena company puts up a jobl lising onindeed and they get 10,000 applicantsthe ATS that they pay for the softwarethat they they pay for will go throughand either organize or assign value orweed out or whatever differentapplicants that it thinks are relevantor irrelevant now the problem is that alot of ATS systems are kind of dumb nowif you are filling out onlineapplications there is a very very goodchance that your resume is going to getsucked into an ATS vacuum and you needto make sure that it is what we call ATSfriendly that means if you submit yourresumes to jpeg it's not going to likethat it's going to be like I can't readjpeg you're you're rejected even if youwere a canidate it's going to be like Idon't I don't like this I can't readthis so you need to make sure that it'sATS friendly because these ATS systemsare notoriously a little dumb so how dowe do that we keep our resume simple wekeep the formatting simple we make themnice and boring no funky Graphics nofunky fonts no funky formatting no funkypictures you just got a kiss keep itsimple silly step one the brain dump sobefore we actually go into making ourresume we're going to do one thingreally quick that's going to save you somuch time and it's going to help youmake much stronger and more effectiveresumes I call it the brain dump we aregoing to open a blank document and writedown everything we've ever doneprofessionally this is a living documentso it's something that you are going tokeep updating for the rest of your lifeso you want to keep it somewhere safe Isuggest just opening up a Google Dockand just having it in the cloud itdoesn't need to be pretty it doesn'tneed to be formatted any type of wayit's just for you so start with youreducation where did you go to highschool college what were you involved inwere you in any clubs or associationswhat were some of your relevant coursesyour GPA What towns were they in did youget any certifications or anyregistrations did you take any

lawns in high school tointernships and apprenticeships tempwork contract work all the way up topart-time and full-time work and then ifyou can write 5 to 10 bullet points foreach section and a pro tip for writingbullet points cuz it is just so hard andI'm always trying to find ways to makeit easier for yall go to the jobdescription for a job that's similarthat's hiring right now so for exampleif I worked as a video editor for anadvertising agency I would go to likeindor Zip recruiter or LinkedIn and lookfor a company that's currently hiringthat and look at the bullet points forfor what they're looking for in thatrole and that's a good place to kind ofgain inspiration for what to write asyour bullet points if that makes anysense and then you can always use youknow chat EBT you can always

collaborativeteamwork this is your opportunity to layeverything out on the table it's goingto feel great step two is your resumétemplate okay now we can open up a niceblank resumé template and just startfrom scratch now in case you didn't knowthis you need to tailor your resume forevery single job that you apply to Iknow you're thinking Aaron I don't havetime to make a brand new resume forevery single job that's ridiculous Ihave two things to say to that Mr SirMadam number one you're not making abrand new resume from scratch all I'masking you to do is tailor it for thatrole that can mean just swapping out afew words and we'll get into that soonsecond tailing your resume is not awaste of time it is going to save you somuch time down the road because it'sgoing to help you get a job quickerapplying to random jobs you find onlinewith the same generic resume is afantastic way to not get an interviewask any recruiter they hate getting ageneric resume that they obviously cantell was not tailored for the role andimmedate throwaway okay okay this is anillustration I like to use to help justlike drill this in so imagine it's a hotsummer day and all you want is a crispcold fresh Coca-Cola like one of thoselike Mexican coca-colas you know likethe really really good ones and so twowaiters come up to you one has a silverplatter with a white handkerchief andjust one crisp cold Coca-Cola Mexicancooca Cola in a glass here you go theother waiter comes up to you and he alsohas a silver platter with a nice whitecloth but on that platter he has acouple Sprites and some orange juice Ithink those are a few Pepsis is there aFanta on there oh and then in the back Ithink he has a there's a Coca-Cola in aglass but I can't can't really tell yepthat's a Coca-Cola which platter are yougoing to reach for the one showing youexactly what you want that's whattailoring your resume is doing when youadd other details that aren't relevantthat's not what they're looking for it'sjust a distraction it's wasting theirtime you need to show these recruiterswho are usually just scanning RS andjust skimming looking for keywords youjust need to show them exactly whatthey're looking for very clearly foryour convenience I've broken it downinto three parts professional resumeathletic and special skills resume andDwight tro trivia not tailoring a resumeis a waste of your own time and it'sworking hard and not working smart Idigress and SC to get off my high horsehere get down from my Soap Box anyway soit's time to pick out your resume 10 ifyou're in a more conservative industryyou know like Finance or law you mightwant to go with the more likeconservative template but if you're inanother industry like creative or Techyou can usually get away with a MoreDesign forward template but honestly aslong as it's simple and legible andprioritizes readability over everythingyou can't go wrong and of course I'mgoing to link to some of my favoriteresumé templates down in the descriptionso go check them out down there on topart three which is sections okay soresumés are pretty subjective for themost part but there are five sectionsthat you should have on every singleresume no no matter what they areexpecting to see these sections numberone is your name number two is yourcontact information number three is yourrelevant past experience number four isyour education and number five are yourskills you can also add additionalsections if you want like Awardsvolunteer experience languages is a bigone they're not necessarily requiredlike the other sections but they'regreat to have and there's one additionalsection on your resume that I highlyhighly recommend that you have studiesshow that if you have this one sectionon your resume and you do it right itwill supercharge your chances of gettingthe interview and the job what is thissection a professional summary I am ahuge fan of professional summaries Imean the research doesn't lie recruiterslove a well-written professional summaryalso they are a great life hack becauseif you don't have the time to go throughand tailor your entire resume you canjust tailor your little summary at thetop and they will love it I love it theyare so incredibly powerful especially inthis age of social media where we are soused to seeing people just still downtheir entire beings into this little bioyou know if it's on Instagram they havea little bio if it's on hinge you knowthey just just we're so used to seeingpeople just like summarize themselves soa professional summary is a fantasticway to just say right to the recruiteror the department head or the hiringmanager I am who you are looking for nowif you want to know how to write themost incredible professional summary Ihave a template for you no matter whoyou are just starting out switchingcareers or you've been doing it fordecades go watch this video because Ihave a template for you that walks youthrough exactly how to do it I getmessages all the time from people sayingAaron I did it I integrated the summaryand I'm getting all these interviews nowI can't keep up and I'm just telling youyou got to trust me you got to listeneron you got you you got to listen to meI know what I'm talking about go watchthis video save it for later or do whatyou got to do and just know if you writea professional summary on yourresume I like you okay so generally onyour resume you want to list things outfrom most important to least importantso if you're applying for a rle whereyour education is like super duper duperimportant you can shift that to the topof the page but if you're just normallike the rest of us typically it's bestto go your name contact info relevantpast experience education skills that isthe conventional format however there isanother ré format that I am a huge fanof and that I personally use and it iscalled a functional rume so achronological resumé is when you listout your experience from oldest to mostrecent but a functional resumé is askills forward resume so you have yourname and contact information the same atthe top but then instead of having yourrelevant experience front and center youhave your skills front center and thenunderneath that you have your relevantexperience education whatever else whatI love about functional resumes is thatthey're great for people who have a biggap in their career and they don't wantto draw so much attention to like theirtimeline or for people who are changingcareers and you can really highlightyour skills that you have as opposed tolike your past experience or for peoplelike me who have technical skills andthose technical skills are the mostimportant aspect of getting an interviewso for example me I'm a video editorknowing Premiere knowing D Vinci knowingaudition knowing After Effects all thesesoft is Paramount so I always list myskills right there at the top just sothe recruiter knows okay this personknows what they're doing they have theirname contact information professionalsummary skills and then companies Iworked for at the bottom now if you'rein an industry where they care aboutyour career Arc and what companiesyou've worked for maybe like business orconsulting or Finance then you mightwant to do a chronological resume but ifthey're really Des hiring you for yourskills I love a good functional resumethey are beautiful part four is keywordsso after we've completed our brandpicked out our template organized oursections it's time to start filling outyour resume so again keywords are so soimportant because your resume is firstgoing to be seen by probably like ahiring manager or recruiter so I'm notsomebody who like is super superfamiliar with your job but they're givena job description and a bunch ofkeywords to look for and they're lookingat your resume and they're just scanningfor those keywords so you want to makesure that your resumé reflects the jobdescription as much as possible sosomething that I like to do is I like totake the job description and just copyand paste it into my resume documentthat I'm working in and just keep it inmind as I'm writing my bullet points youcould even throw the job descriptioninto you know something like Chachi BTand then write a prompt like I'mapplying for this role and then writeabout your previous experience and thensay can you you know write some bulletpoints that reflect the keywords in thisjob description another thing with thesebullet points is that you want toquantify as much as possible I don'tknow what it is about humans but theylove numbers we love statistics wegravitate towards numbers and theyreally simplify things so instead ofsaying oh I edited videos for this brandI would say edited 3 to five videosweekly you know just adding like alittle juice and it doesn't have to beexact okay the numbers nobody's going toarrest you if the numbers are a coupledigits off just just do your best so forexample if I'm looking at this jopdescription and it says that I need tobe able to work with this team and hereare the skills I need to know you knowAdobe Dropbox then I want to make surethat all of those words are in my resumeat least once so that when theireyeballs are skimming they see all thosekeywords light up and they're like thisis this is the person let's just givethem the offer now let's double itdouble it for them give them all of ourmoney sell the business with themsomething to keep in mind is thatrecruiters hiring managers whoever isreviewing your resume is going to spendmost of their few seconds that they'reskimming it in the top left corner ofyour resume they're going to kind of doa little scan so you want to make surethat the top left quadrant of yourresume has some of those keywords someof those things to to grip them and makethem think okay I should read the restof this resume that's all you're tryingto get them to do is just say okay Ishould spend a few more seconds on thisresume put them in the yes pile so onceyou feel like you filled out the contentof your resume and you're feeling prettygood about it you got numbers in thereit's nice and juicy and specific you gotkeywords it's looking it's looking fireI would highly recommend downloading thePlugin grammarly or using spell check toproof read the snap out of that resume Iam a typo queen and I go nowhere withoutmy grammarly now I love it so much itsaves my booty all day by the way I dofree resume reviews on Instagram sofollow me there for the details I willget a resumé and it'll have a a typo onit and every single time I see a resumewith a typo and if I find the typo thatmeans it's bad cuz I'm bad at findingtypos they almost always have detailoriented in their skill section y'all ifyou have detail oriented in your skillsection and you have errors on yourresume like immediately know immediatelyknow cuz I don't care immediately knowimmediately know immediately know so getgrammarly use spell check get yourdetail oriented friend read yourresonate backwards do what you have todo to make make sure there are noinconsistencies or errorsinconsistencies are another big thingyou want to make sure that all of yourbullet points are using the same tenseyou want to make sure you're not usingany pronouns you don't want to say likeI edited videos you just want to saylike edited videos it's just all theselittle professional etiquette thingswith resumés that we all follow for somereason and also if you do complete yourresume and you're like this is lookingthis is looking pretty good Aaron I likethis resume there is a website calledjob scan where you can throw your resumein and then you copy and paste the jobdescription and you you plop that in aswell and it's kind of like a generic ATSscanner so it will scan your resume scanthe job description and then it willspit out like a score like you got a Bminus make it better again it's not likethey're not all ats's are not all thesame but it's just kind of a fun thingto do it's like free I think for yourfirst like five RS or something I'll puta link to job scan down in thedescription too wow lots of links in thedescription today so I can talk about RSall night all week all month but I needto stop myself here I mean at the end ofthe day I think resumes are kind of dumbbecause they discriminate against peoplewho don't know how to design and theydon't know how to write or they justdon't know how to make them and nobodyever taught them so then they pay $800for a resume writer to write the worstresume ever and they get entirelyscrewed over instead

      "I know a person with a master's degreein computer science that is deliveringpizzas it's tough out there right nowyou've applied to so many jobs they allblend together into one big giant entitythat you both can't stop thinking aboutand also hasn't called you back youspend all this time going to school andthere aren't any entry-level jobs ormaybe you just got laid off theseverance package is about to run outand the bills are starting to pile upthe job market was so hot just 18 monthsago what happened I know it's rough outthere so I made this video to help ifyou're new to the channel my name isSteve win and I'm an L7 principalsoftware engineer basically I makevideos that I wish existed when I wascoming up in the industry I've neverreally had to search for a job becauseI've spent my entire 18-year career atAmazon but I have been on the other sideof the table reviewing resumés doingphone screens and conducting interviewsI've conducted over 850 technicalinterviews for Amazon I'm a bar raiserand I've trained over a th000 peoplewithin the company on how to conduct andassess talent and I've seen a ton offailure modes that are really prettyeasy to avoid so I'll share theselessons with you in this video before Iget to my first point let's compare twohypothetical people in a thoughtexperiment Alice and Bob both are recentgraduates and are looking for jobs intoday's tough Market Bob has machineguned his resume to hundreds of jobopenings after he wakes up in themorning he spends his days applying tomore jobs scrolling videos onlineworking on a leak code question aboutdynamic programming that he's been stuckon all week and playing video games Bobis pretty sure that he's doubled maybetriple applied to some jobs but itdoesn't matter because they haven'tcalled them back anyways then there'sAlice Alice has a spreadsheet to trackall of the jobs she's applied to beforeshe applies she spends a bit of timeunderstanding what each company does andwhat their needs are in a column on thatspreadsheet she is constantly updating aresume and has several versions based onwhat type of role she's applying to shekeeps a log of all of her job searchactivities like every time she's reachedout to her network or when she hasn'theard back from referrals she's alsosystematic about the coding problemshe's done and spends a bit of timelearning The Core Concepts behindproblems that give her her trouble she'salways on the lookout for skills thatmight make her more attractive toemployers currently she's learning allshe can about AI even though she didn'treally study it in school Alice getsstarted at 8:00 a.m. in the morning andshe's done with her work by lunchtimeafterwards she does whatever she wantsgiven what you know about Alice and Bobwho has the better chance of Landing ajob I would bet my money on Alice andthat's my first point you increase yourchances of Landing a job by stayingorganized and being disciplined treat itlike a part-time job that leads to afull-time job if you do it well taking astructured and disciplined approachdoesn't mean going into monk mode itjust means taking a couple hours of theday seriously getting dressed in themorning getting organized by trackingyour activity or spreadsheets and focuson growing and showcasing your skillswhen the market starts to pick back upyou want to be ready to go nobody knowswhen that will be but it will happenwhen Bob gets a call back for aninterview he's going to have to cram toprepare as opposed to Alice who has kepther interviewing skills warm during thedry spell looking for a job especiallyyour first one is an ambiguous andchaotic process you combat ambiguity andchaos with structure and discipline I'dlike to take a moment to thank today'svideo sponsor dice the process ofLanding a job has two discrete phasesLanding the interview by getting noticedand then performing well enough for theinterview to land an offer I've teamedup with dice to provide a comprehensiveset of resources for both of these phesif you're looking for a job right nowyou need to leverage as many resourcesas you can especially high quality andfree ones if you're struggling withresumé writing you're not alone I'veseen so many terrible resumés in mycareer and they were all bad fordifferent reasons there's a lot can gowrong dice has dozens of articles on howto craft effective resumés especiallyfor Tech professionals your CV or resumeis probably the only interaction thatyou'll have with many of the employersthat you apply to you probably want tohave several versions and you want eachof them to stand out the articles arefilled with templates samples and adviceon how to create RS that will pop andwill land you your next interview thereare also dozens of articles on preparingfor the interview side of things somearticles that caught my eye are six waysto blow a job interview how to researcha manager before the job and one on howto leverage your personal projectss andstories when looking for your first techjob the last one is especially usefulfor people straight out of school linksto these articles and more can be foundin the description thanks again to dicefor sponsoring today's video and makingall of these resources available forfree before I highlight my second Pointlet me tell you the story of how I gotmy job at Amazon after college in 2006 Ihad a terrible time looking for work Iwas a good programmer and had a solidgrasp of data structures and algorithmsbut because I lacked a computer sciencedegree and any relevant job experience Iwasn't getting any callbacks the onlything on my resume was when I worked atChuck-E-Cheese during high school duringmy job search I was surprised to receivea call from a friend let's call himConnor who I hadn't heard from sincehigh school Connor was currently workingat Amazon and wanted to know if I wantedto meet up for a drink the reason hecalled was that he had just met acooworker Heather and discovered thatthey grew up in the same town as I didbut attended different high schoolssince it wasn't a large city they rackedtheir brains trying to find people thatthey knew in common when my name came upI briefly dated Heather way back whenand we parted on good terms and in highschool I spent many hours helping Connorprepare for the AP Computer Science testin college they went on to major incomputer science and ended up as sdes atAmazon working on adjacent teams oversome fine craft Pacific Northwest beerin a dingi dive bar in Seattle Ipersuaded Connor to get me an interviewat Amazon since I spent so much timeback in high school helping him with theAP test he was able to secure me aninterview and the rest is history thereason I'm telling you the story isbecause my second point the strength ofthe connections you have in your networkcan greatly increase the chances ofLanding a job you may be saying toyourself but Steve I don't have anetwork you get a network by getting ajob and I don't have a job it's a catch22 well what I say to you is that you dohave a network everybody has a networkand so it's not a catch22 and I don'tappreciate the attitude networking isn'tabout contacting everybody you know andasking and begging for a job it's aboutmaking sure your connections are strongfor people that you already know do yourfamily and friends all know that you'relooking for work this may involveexplaining to them what type of jobyou're looking for Uncle Daniel may notknow anything about computers or theinternet but he knows a ton of people atchurch and you can let them know thatyou're looking for work also make sureto keep your non- Tech connection strongas well if you went to college or did aboot camp you know people in theindustry reach out to them ask them foradvice and leads if they have a job askfor a referral it's not weird everyonethat can help will help because in thefuture the tables might be turned it'snot just about taking all the time butalso giving can you help people in yourNetwork maybe someone's trying to learnhow to code and you can help them maybeyou can introduce two people that youknow with similar interests and careertrajectories if you don't believe meabout leveraging your network go askpeople you know about how they got theirjobs it's not just me a sizable amountof folks will tell you the same thingthat they got their shot by usingconnections from their Network areferral from someone you know is thepath of least resistance to Landing aninterview who you know is greater thanwhat you know but people can't help youif you don't reach out and tell them andif you get a referral please make sureto follow follow up since the economyhas been in a downturn I've received aton of requests for referrals at Amazonand I'm happy to help I tell them allthe same thing go to the job's websiteand find an opening that's a good fitemail the link to me along with yourresume so I can submit a referral now Ican't guarantee an interview but I canfollow up internally to make sure youget a call back because I can follow upwith the hiring manager or recruiter andout of all of the people that reachedout to me only one person has actuallysent me their resume and that personhasn't followed up to ask me about thestatus of their application it's goingto require some follow through but not alot so it's important to leverage yournetwork and to stay organized before Iget to my last point I want to tell youa story about someone I interviewed Iwent into the interview thinking that itwas going to be a slam dunk they were areferral from someone I knew and Itrusted at work they came from anotherhighly respected tech company and wereapplying to the same role and level atAmazon the team they were applying toworked on the same type of backendsystems that he had experience in it wasessentially the same Tech stack and ittotally made sense why they were leavingtheir old company he needed a mentalhealth break and he was stuck working onmaintaining a large and wonky code basethe new team had an aggressive road mapand wanted to ship a bunch of new stuffso he took 6 months off to recharge andto travel but here's the thing hecompletely bombed the interview every SEat Amazon has to demonstrate that theyknow how to code and it was clear to methat this person knew how to code but hedidn't spend any time preparing for theinterview and it wasn't just myinterview it was Apparent from theentire Loop that he didn't prepare atall he had let his interview muscleatrophy and that's my third point youhave to keep your interviewing skillswarm even if you aren't getting any callbacks remember there are two phases togetting a new job Landing the interviewand Performing well enough in theinterview to get an offer and at thestart of your job search you probablywent all out with preparing for theinterview because of the lack ofcallbacks though you've let yourinterview preparation laps the secret isto leverage the science of learning andmemory if you're familiar with theebbing house forgetting curve you'llknow that relearning something thatyou've learned in the past is going totake much less time than if you startedfrom Square One what you relearn is alsomuch more likely to be retained forlonger the more times you review it soit's important to set time away everyday to review things that you shouldalready know pick some random leak codequestions to make sure that they've beencommitted to long-term memory andschedule a mock interview every month orso with some friends that are alsounemployed maintenance of things thatyou've already learned is going to costlike 5 to 10% of how long it took tolearn something originally but if youlet your form lapse you'll be like theguy I interviewed who is really wellqualified but decided to skip anypreparation during his time off whichwas a waste of time for involved if youfound this video useful you need to makesure that you're well prepared forBehavioral interviews too it can be thedifference between getting down leveledand losing out on hundreds of thousandsof dollars during the offer phase socheck out my video on how to tell a goodstory\n",

      "hey there welcome or welcome back to mychannel I am Tama Thompson and I am theowner and resumé writer at Thompsonresumé writing company and for thisvideo I am going to be giving you someeasy tips on how you can create atopnotch resume in 2024 so if you knowfor a fact that you are someone who'sgoing to be job searching this yearmaybe you want to go after your veryfirst sixf figure job maybe you want togo after or pursue new opportunitiesthat are going to pay you what youdeserve and what you're worth or maybeyou simply just want to advance in yourcareer maybe you're a specialist but youwant to be a manager maybe you're amanager but you want to be a directorwhatever your reason is for wanting tosearch for a new job this year I want toensure that you are equipped with thebest possible resume so that you canbeat out competing applicants land moreinterviews more callbacks andpotentially more job offers so withoutfurther Ado let's get right into itnumber one on this list is to make surethat it does not exceed two pages now Idid record an entire video on this abouthow long your resume should be but intheory unless you are in a particularfield or unless the recruiter or the jobspecifically is asking for it do nothave your resume exceed two pages youguys two pages should be more thanenough space for you to clearlycommunicate your value your skills youreducation your past experiences Etcdo not go over two pages it's estimatedthat recruiters only spend on averagebetween 6 to 8 seconds scanning a resumein its entirety and if they arescrolling through a resume that is threefour five pages long that can increaseyour chances of getting rejected whichis what you don't want especially if youare qualified now I know that two pagesdoes not sound like a lot but it is ifyou're making sure that you're not goingtoo far back into your job history ifyou make sure that you are formattingyour skills correctly and if you makesure that your sentences are between oneto two lines only then you should befine back in the day it used to bestandard for resumés to only be one pagebut that is no longer the case so you donot have to worry about stressingyourself out trying to fit all of yourinformation on one page you do have twopages but the key is to use that spacewisely when you are writing your resumeif you find that your resume isexceeding that two-page maximum that canbe a sign that you may need to combthrough the document and remove someinformation maybe shorten some sentencesswap some things out Etc so that you arenot exceeding that two-page maximumlength and a lot of people think thathowever long their resume is doesn'treally play a factor in whether it getsread or not but I am here to tell youthat that is not the case the key is tomake sure that those pages or that onepage or those two pages is filled withvaluable information and I did record aseries of videos teaching you all howyou can Infuse and incorporate valueinto your resume number two on this listand I feel like I kind of gave it awayin point number one but that is to makesure that your bullet points your jobbullet points any statements that youhave listed on your resume does notexceed one to two sentences this cankeep you from having large chunky textHeavy paragraphs that tend to be areally big turnoff for recruiters and inturn make the document difficult todigest comprehend and comb through alogtogether and I also recorded anothervideo giving you all some tips on thebest way to construct the perfect jobbullet point and a key hint that I notedin that video is to make sure that yourjob bullet points do not exceed one totwo sentences within those one to twosentences you want to make sure that youare including value numbers outcomesresults to clearly communicate what youcurrently bring to the table in yourexisting role and what you've brought tothe table in past roles and keeping yourjob bullet points only one to twosentences can also make it easier foryou to stay within that twopage can also make it easier for you tostay within that two-page parameter thatwe just talked about if you find thatany of your job bullet points or any ofyour sentences overall within yourresume are extending past that one totwo sentence line then you may have tocomb through the statement and see ifyou can swap out some words for othersif you can be more specific and ifthere's anything that you have to cutout also something to note here try toavoid having more than seven bulletpoints per job description based on thetime frame that you were in your role soif you were only in a position for ashort period of time maybe 3 to 5 monthsmaybe 3 to 6 months or even less than ayear you don't want to go past three tofive bullet points in general the onlytime where it's acceptable for you to gopast seven bullet points in a jobdescription listed on your resume is ifyou've been in a position for anextended period of time so if you'vebeen there longer than 5 years 7 yearsanything less than that don't go overseven bullet points number three on thislist is to focus on communicatingoutcomes and results as a result of yourefforts in your position so stay awayfrom using phrases like responsible foror completed duties and tasks asassigned that's not what recruiters wantto see and I guarantee you that that'snot a keyword that they're looking foreither so you want to focus on outcomesand results what I mean by this isinclude numbers data statistics factsabout what you have delivered for thecompany now this can include increasesdecreases something that you'vemaximized something that you'veminimized something that you've cutsomething that you've eliminatedsomething that you've eradicatedsomething that you implemented I couldgo on and on and on and on but you getthe gist an easy way to do this is tomake sure that every sentence and everystatement that you have on your resumeincludes a number and includes a figureif you are someone who may not know whatthe outcome of your efforts may be youcan either reach out to your manager orsee if there's any system or databasethat you can log into that you work withto possibly get some numbers so forexample if you are a Sal professionaland you want to see how much money insales you've brought in for the companysince you started by including numbersand figures you're making it very clearhey this is what I can bring to yourcompany I can increase this I canincrease sales I can increase profits Ican increase foot traffic I can optimizeyour campaigns I can cut spending I canbetter allocate spending and so on andso forth so instead of just sayingresponsible for yada yada yada you'resaying increase sales by 35% which hasway more of an impact and is probablygoing to catch your recruiter'sattention more number four on this listis to make sure that you conduct keywordresearch before you start writing yourresume and I cannot stress theimportance of this enough now I didrecord an entire video teaching you allhow to conduct keyword research and whatit is but I want to reemphasize it inthis video because it is super importantin order to make sure that your resumegets past all of those app applicanttracking systems out there now it'sestimated that over 75% of recruiterssay that they do use some sort of anapplicant tracking system this meansthat when you submit your resume for ajob it's not going directly to therecruiter but rather it's going througha system that is systematically andautomatically combing through thatdocument to make sure that that you area qualified candidate for this positionand some key words that a recruitermight enter into the system to look forcan include skills education past jobtitle some simple ways that you can makeyour resumé keyword enriched can includeworking with a resumé writer such asmyself or combing through 3 to five or 5to S job descriptions to really get afeel for the common keywords that arelisted throughout them so that you knowideally in theory what a recruiter islooking for for the positions that youare applying to and you want toincorporate those keywords allthroughout your resume so in yourheadline in your professional summary inyour job book L next on this list is tomake sure that you target your resumeand you can do this very easily bysimply just putting a headline rightbefore your professional summary butafter your contact information and youcan use a series of combinations forthis number one is your job title soespecially if you are going forpositions that are very similar or ifare not the exact same as a positionthat you have now so I'll use myself asan example I am a marketing manager soat the very top of my resume it saysTama Thompson comma marketing managerthe next way that you can Target yourresume is by your job title as well asyour industry so if you have asignificant number of years ofexperience in a particular industrymaybe it's Health Care maybe it's retailmaybe it's Tech you can go ahead and useyour job title plus that industry sousing myself as an example again if mybackground was primarily in Tech itwould say Tech marketing manager and thefinal way that you can Target yourresume is by job title plus industryplus area or skill of expertise I alwayslike to say that a general resume is fora general job but a targeted resume isfor specific exclusive careeropportunities that you will be applyingto not to mention you're probably notgoing to be applying to any and everyjob out there because you are not forany and every job so you shouldn't haveyour resume written in a way that is forany and every job you want to make surethat you're targeting it so that you areattracting and you're able to increaseyour chances of Landing interviews forjobs that you really want to go for laston this list is to make sure that you'renot using any complicated or difficultto read or difficult to comprehendlayouts or templates and I did record avideo on this that I shared to mychannel as well templates tend to be aneasy route that people take so someonewill go to Etsy or canva or evenMicrosoft Word and just download atemplate and then they'll just copy andpaste and kind of plug andplay theirinformation sometimes templates can doyou a disservice especially if thetemplate is too busy or too complicatedso I've seen some templates that aremore graphic design focused than theyare in making sure that the person'sskills and experience are able to bepresented properly within the documentand what I mean by this is like thetemplate will be very pretty I've seenblush themed templates I've seen goldtemplates but sometimes they don't giveenough space for you to enter in yourinformation so like every bullet pointwill be literally just a couple of wordssometimes it'll have a lot of picturesand a lot of Graphics in there sometimesit will allow you to insert your picturein there all of that stuff is notimportant what really matters the mostis that you have a well-written documentthat communicates your value I've alsoseen templates that have a lot ofcolumns and while the ATS system canprocess columns you want to avoid havingyour entire resume be in a columnedformat another type of template layoutthat you want to avoid is any templatethat does not read naturally from leftto right so naturally our eyes read fromleft to right just in general so thinkthis way this way this way this way it'sin a z pattern any template that has theI reading from here to here to here tohere here bouncing up here going overhere going over here those are the onesthat you want to avoid this is not tosay that you shouldn't use templates atall there are a lot of ATS friendlytemplates out there if you don't want touse templates you can simply lay yourresume out from top to bottom left toright in Microsoft Word it's very easyto do this and more simple than youthink I've also seen a lot of people whowill use those type of templates andalthough they have a lot of greatexperience and ideally they arequalified for the role they'reexperiencing a lot of rejection becausethe template that they're using isgarbage and I don't want that to be youso those are some super simple easy waysthat you can create a topnotch resume in2024 listen there are hundreds ofthousands of jobs that are up for grabsand up for the taking and I want you tobe able to go after those jobs andinterview for those jobs and get thosejobs whether you're going for a 100%remote position or a hybrid position Iwant to make sure that you are applyingwith an optimized resume that is goingto get you interviews because after allthat's the first step without interviewswithout callbacks your job search isgoing to suffer and your resume is a keypart in making

      "I'm scared to make this video over thepast two months I've applied to over 500jobs using five almost identical resumesto see what recruiters care about whendetermining whether or not they shouldgive someone an interview the resultsare a little scary twice the number ofinterviews then resume number two thisone was eye-opening that is astronomicalhas anyone heard of this company 18interviews 18 interview rate wow this ismind-blowing you can take control ofyour resume if your resume looks likethis throw it out to the dumpsterso without further Ado let's get into itthe plan is simple make one resumeapplied to 100 jobs then make fouridentical resumes with small tweaks hereand there and see how many interviews Iget however many interviews I get thatis what we're gonna call the interviewrate you then get that same exact resumeand make one small tweak the name thecompany that you worked at a job Gap thetemplate a resume that you use thenusing each of those resumes to apply tothe same 100 jobs and the results arestaggering here's resume number one youcan see here I opted for a Caucasianmale name way at the top I put FacebookAKA meta as a first work experience Ikept all the other bullet points thesame this is a fake spam email thenumber is fake so don't try to call meyou freaking weirdos I'm just kidding asyou can see here the most recentexperience is meta I wanted to normalizeit to make sure that this resume wasgoing to get interviews added someentrepreneurial experience at WilliamsCollege this is a good standard resumeso this is going to be our controlvariable yes I'm talking about the thingthat we all learned in seventh gradescience I applied to 100 jobs that weretailored to this resume and guess howmany interviews this one got 18interviews 18 interview rate 18 out of100 job applications now by all meansthis is a great percentage anythingabove a five percent interview rate isgreat 18 that is astronomical we knowthat this resume works now let's pop upresume number two do you notice thedifference resume number one resumenumber two resume number one resumenumber two resume number one my watchkeeps turning off has anyone heard ofthis companyindigenous ninjasenergysynthesis I don't know I'll scrolling onLinkedIn found a company name that wasthe most obscure that I could find and Iput it on this resume notice how thesetwo resumes are almost identical theonly difference between these tworesumes is the brand and the companyname and that's it this one got a totalof 10 interviews let's pause for asecond pull up resume number one and twoagain resume number one and resumenumber two notice how the bullet pointsare the exact same yet resume number onehad almost twice the number ofinterviews than resume number two sobrand name yes that matters brand namewill get you almost twice the number ofinterviews on your resume that youotherwise wouldn't have gotten but let'stake a step back here let's imagine thatyou're on Googlewe're doing Google search maybe we cando Google Search up likeum resume templates there's like theones with a lot of colors and maybe aphoto and all the stuff in thebackground you find this beautifulresume template and now you're thinkingto yourself okay wow I'm definitelygonna get interviewed this is what Icall Beautiful resumes a beautifulresume is one that optimizes for the eyeit has a lot of color it has two columnsthree columns but it's not reallyintuitive to read a functional resume isdesigned for readability and that's whatwe had with resume one and two so Iintroduce you resume number three thisis a resume template I made on canva ithas as much of the same information Icould fit on there again I would arguethat resume number three is actuallymore beautiful than resume number onebased on that you would think okayresume number three is gonna get moreinterviews right this one waseye-opening even though this one hadmeta on Facebook on the resume eventhough that the bullet points were thesame this one got a total of eightinterviews even less than and having abrand name company on your resume thatis crazy if your resume looks like thisthrow it out to the dumpster and maybe aJordan we can add like a dumpsteranimation or something use a resumetemplate similar to resume templatenumber one copy that structure find itin the description below that's what'sgoing to get you interviews theexception to this rule is if you'regoing to a design related function thenmaybe you could add a little bit of yourspice into it but for everything elsekeep it simple keep it structuredrecruiters love it so this is where Istopped my experiment because I was likewow this is mind-blowing I asked all ofyou guys on my Instagram and Tick Tockwhat experiment you wanted me to do nextand so I added on two more just for youwhat happens if we use the exact sameresume but we used an ethnic woman'sname we see companies talk aboutdiversity equity and inclusioninitiatives all the time but does itactually translate well to a fairprocess let's find out this is resumenumber four notice how it's almostidentical called the resume number onewe're keeping the tests exactly the sameI did change a company name to anotherbig tech company name I didn't want itto be flagged by the recruiter when Iwas applying to the same jobs this onehad 10 interviews compared to resumenumber one that had a Caucasian whitemale name that is mind-blowing justbecause of your name almost half theinterviews and this is not a newdiscovery Harvard did a study on howthey believe that application should beanonymized because by anonymizing it itmakes the application process fair andsimple for everybody what's the takeawayif you have an ethnic name like mine CheHockley we have to play around this gameforeignquestions I get is Jerry what should Ido if I'm going back into the job ForceWorkforce Job Forcework Workforce we have resume numberfive this one had a three year job Gapthis one had eight interviews a lot ofthe percentages are the same I don'trealize so this one had a very similarinterview rate as a canva resumetemplate but I can almost understand whyfrom an employer's perspective anemployer is going to look at this resumeand think to themselves wow this personhasn't been out of work for three yearscan they adapt to this new workingenvironment but that's not going to stopyou from taking action if you have a jobgap on your resume this is what I wantyou to do first things first is I wantyou to remove the months off of yourresume eliminate the bias for people toask you hey you out of work for threemonths why is that nah the second thingI want you to do start taking coursesimmediately it can be relevant to yourfield or it could be relevant to thefield you want to get into LinkedIn hasa bunch of great

      "3 million that is the number of rumsGoogle receives every year and of thoseapplicants they only hire around0.2% in this video I'm going to show youhow to write a resume that's going tograb any recruiters attention regardlessof your professional background this isa Formula that I use to help my clientsgo from constant rejection to Landinginterviews with their dream companiesI've spent the last decade workingfull-time as a technical recruiter andTechnical recruiting leader forcompanies like Google Lyft Uber Tik Tokand the New York Times I reviewedhundreds of thousands of resumés hiredhundreds of people and helped many jobSeekers succeed so for example my clientCameron was really unhappy in his jobdidn't even want to go to work wasn'table to get any traction when he wouldapply to jobs didn't know what to do andafter working with me we were able toget him 10 job interviews and he got ajob offer in 2 weeks then you have myother client Ravi who was really stuckin his dead end job and really had somelong-term goals that he wanted to to getto so after working with me we were ableto get him his next job with a$100,000 pay increase and he and hiswife were able to pay off their studentloan debt so in this video I'm going tobreak down the formula that I use on myclients to help them revamp theirresumes and of course stay until the endcuz then I'm going to give you the goodstuff the secret SAU keep watchingsection one preparation before you startwriting your resume it is reallyimportant that you do your research andstudy the market the the reason why isbecause if you don't do that you'regoing to fall into this trap that mostpeople fall into which is creating ageneric resume in today's job market itis more important than ever to create aresume that is tailored to the jobfamily or job vertical that you'rewanting to apply for when you have ageneric resume it really makes itdifficult for recruiters to reallyunderstand who you are and the valuethat you actually bring to the job andthe company that you're applying to soin this first step when you study theMarket you're going to make a list firstyou're going to make a list of thecompanies that you want to work for thenyou're going to make a list of the jobsthat you want to apply for then you'regoing to head over to those companiespages and you're going to look atLinkedIn and go scrape those job boardsand see what jobs are posted when you goto LinkedIn and you look for jobs youmay actually find companies that youweren't really interested in the past oryou hadn't thought of but they have ajob opening that's really enticing whenyou do this research what you're goingto notice are patterns you're going tofind these through points between eachof these roles now once you find thosethrough points then you're going to beable to craft a resume that's going tobe tailored to those jobs that you wantto apply for that way when you do writeyour resume and you need to tailor itmore specifically to the jobs thatyou're applying for it's only going totake a couple of minutes now once you'vecompleted this step then we can go tothe next step which is to build yourresume section two Market your personalbrand your resume is a document thatmarkets you to potential employers basedon your past experience and andachievements it needs to reflect who youare as a business professional so let'stalk about the summary section on therese now I'll be really honest as arecruiter I don't really read summariesI go straight down to the experiencesection to determine if your experiencealigns to the job that you're applyingfor however if you're in a situationthat requires a little bit of extraexplanation so for example if you werelaid off from your last job you canactually mention that in the summary ifyou want to relocate you can mentionthat in the summary you can say open torelocation if you are making a careertransition this summary will allow youthe opportunity to explain how yourskill set aligns to this job that you'reapplying for so here are the steps tocrafting your professional summary whoyou are professionally begin with aclear statement of your professionalcapacities for example you can sayexperienced marketing manager with aproven track record in digital marketingand brand management value propositionand evidence so you're going to followthis with a value proposition thatincludes evidence so mention specificachievements like successfully let acampaign that boosted social mediaengagement by 40% you're going toprovide evidence early on tosubstantiate your claims and make yoursummary much more credible supportingtrade or memorable item add a trade ormemorable item that makes you stand outlike an award or a unique project forexample you can say recipient of the2022 marketing Excellence award forInnovative campaign strategies againavoid generic language like resultsdriven professional or good communicatorall of that makes your summary soundsuper boring and then career goalsclearly State why you're applying forthe position so for example you can sayaiming to apply my expertise in digitalmarketing to help a dynamic companyDrive Innovation and achieve its growthobjectives again identify what's goingto make you stand out and make youunique and separate yourself from all ofthe other applicants this could bespecific skills or experiences oraccomplishments section threeachievements highlighting hiring teamswant to know what you've accomplishedand what business value you're going tobring to that business and the jobyou're applying for think about Sarah asales manager initially her resume listof responsibilities like manage salesteam and develop sales strategies whilethese points were true they didn'teffectively showcase her business impactnow after focusing on her achievementsher bullet points read like thisincreased Regional sales by 25% in oneyear by implementing new trainingprograms and sales strategies also usenumbers whenever possible usepercentages or dollar amounts talk aboutwhat you increased or decreased so forexample you can say increase sales by20% over a 6-month period which is muchmore impactful than just saying increasesales now when you're going to describeyour achievements you can use a claimevidence approach so what you're goingto do is you're going to start with aclaim so for example you can say foryour claim exceeded annual sales quotasthen here's the evidence you can writeachieve $22 million against a goal of 20million in 2020 $25 million against agoal of $23 million in 2021 and on trackto hit $32 million against a goal of $30million in 2022 again what you want todo is you want to highlight the impactin the results of your work companieswant to know did you save the companymoney did you increase profits were youable to increase productivity what werethe results of the work that you've donesection four skill section this is wherea lot of people really mess up becausewhat they end up doing is they end upwriting a lot of generic terms like goodcommunicator now you don't need to listevery single skill that you have insteadlist the skills that you have that arerelevant to the position that you'reapplying to so for example if you usespecific tools let's say Googleanalytics or Salesforce CRM make sureyou list those as well now depending onthe job you're applying for when you'rereading that job description see if theymake mention of your proficiency levelin those tools so for example let's sayyou're applying for a role as a seniorbusiness data analyst and Excel issomething that you need to have for yourjob what you can write in your skillssection is advanced in Excel sectionfive professional experience now this ismy favorite part of a resume becausethis is where you get to really showcaseand highlight who you are and the impactthat you've had on a business businesswhat you want to do is in yourexperience section you want to write outbullet points because it's a lot easierfor the person reading your resume to beable to read it an easy way to writeyour results on your resume is to usethe Google XYZ formula the Google XYZformula States accomplished X asmeasured by y by doing Z and here's anexample you can say increased Regionalsales by 25% by implementing a newtraining program and sales strategiesresulting in a $1.2 million Revenueincrease and again what you want to dois when you've done your research andyou've read the job description alignwhat you've read in the job descriptionto what it is that they're looking forin the experience that you've had and sothat way you can craft your Google XYZformulas to align with the jobs and yourexperience so here's a before and aftertransformation so you can see anotherexample so before responsible foroverseeing marketing campaigns afterdirected a marketing campaign thatincreased website traffic by 30% within3 months by implementing targeted SEOstrategies section six educationeducation is where you're going to listany education that you have outside ofany type of certifications when you listout your education you want to name theinstitution that you went to the degreethat you received and any relevantcoursework that you took that isrelevant to the job that you're applyingfor also if you are a newer graduatemeaning you've graduated in the past 3years what you want to do is you want toinclude your graduation dates and onyour resume move move your education tothe very top of the resume underneathyour contact information the reason whyis because that will easily indicate tothe recruiter that you're a newergraduate if you're beyond 3 years thenwhat you do is move your educationsection to after your experience sectionand remove your dates of graduationhere's an example of how you can writeyour education on your resume Universityof California Berkeley Bachelor of Artsand marketing graduated 2022 honorsMagnum Kare relevant coursework digitalmarketing consumer Behavior marketresearch now if you do have anycertifications you can either create anew section titled certifications andyou can include it there or if you wantto put it into your education sectionlet's say cuz do formatting wise youwant to make sure it fits then at thetop of the section just say educationand certifications then you're going tolist out all of your certifications andif any of those certifications have anytype of IDs go ahead and leave thosethere and if there're any external linksto those certifications so that therecruiter can click on it then includethose as well section seven finaltouches formatting again anotherfavorite I feel like every section is myfavorite but no but really it's myfavorite now the key to formatting isyou want it to be simple and easy toread and make sure it's easily scannablenow I know that there are websites likecanva and on Etsy where you can getresumé templates even though canvaoffers ré templates I do not notrecommend them yes they are beautifuland by the way I subscribe to canva Ithink it's an awesome tool I use it forso many things but when it comes toresumé templates I do not recommend ithere's why most of the time when you aredownloading these resumé templates a lotof them have clip art and bar graphs andplace for your head shot and it reallydetracts and takes away from your resumeso I know that people look at RS as amarketing document but it's not really amarketing document in that way give mean example I'll see a resume and it'llsay like in a skill section it'll sayExcel then it'll have some dots next toit and I'm like what do those dots meanI have no idea it's like an interpretivedance I don't know what it means youdon't want to confuse the recruiter orthe hiring manager so it's better tojust be clear keep it super simple sohere are some tips to write a simple andcleanly designed resume we're going tostart with fonts my favorite fonts touse are Ariel and calbri I use cbri morethan aiel both of them are great I'veseen Times New Roman actually making acomeback and it's Chic I dig itconsistent layout you need to make surethat you have your headings fonts andspacing are consistent throughout theresume it's going to make it look morepolished and more presentable bulletpoints when you are using bullet pointsto period or not to period that is thequestion it's more of a taste thing somepeople say no periods some people sayyes periods it doesn't really matter ifyou use periods or not what does matteris you're doing it consistentlythroughout the resume now bold foremphasis sprinkle a little bold aroundhere and there to emphasize things likewhere you've worked the dates thatyou've worked Etc consistent contactinformation so up at the very top ofyour resume you want to make sure thatyou're very clear about who you are soyou're going to have your name yourlocation your phone pH number your emailaddress your LinkedIn link and any otherrelevant link so for example if you're adesigner if you're in creative and youhave outside portfolios include thoseLinks at the very top of your resume andof course spell check proofread truestory when I worked at Google one of myhiring managers rejected a candidate andI didn't catch it but the resume had aspelling mistake and the hiring managerliterally said this person does not payattention to detail I will not beconsidering them take it from me take itfrom that experience better to spellcheck save as a PDF save your resume asa PDF when you save your file as a PDFand you are applying to jobs it willmaintain the Integrity of the resume soit's going to look the same on yourscreen as it is going to look the sameon the other person's screen now themost important part here are things toavoid so you want to avoid imagesGraphics any type of clip art columnsand tables now the the reason why youwant to remove columns and tables isthat there are some applicant trackingsystems that cannot read those so forexample work day cannot read a resumethat is more than a single column so ifyou have a two column resume it's notgoing to be able to catch all that dataand extract that text section eighttailoring you don't have to rewrite yourresume every time you apply to a jobwhat we just did is we've created aresume for you that's very targeted tothe type of jobs you want to apply forand the type of jobs you want to applyfor really have to be in a singularvertical or a singular job family thenwhat you do is when you did thatresearch like you did at the verybeginning before you wrote your resumenow you're going to go to those jobpostings now you're going to look atthose and you are going to put the jobposting next to your resume and you'regoing to look at them side by side andyou are going to see what parts of yourresume are the same as the jobdescription and what things aredifferent and of those things that aredifferent you're going to include cludethose into your resume and make surethat it is very crystal clear on yourresume that you are a fit for thatposition now a common misconception thatI need to talk about are applicanttracking systems applicant trackingsystems are also known as ATS systemscompanies will license an applicanttracking system and what this is It's adigital filing cabinet and it's built onreally old Legacy technology that's 20years old so when you are applying to arole what what the recruiter has done isthey've gone into the applicant trackingsystem and through the system they'reable to post the job on their careerspage and several external job boardslet's say LinkedIn or indeed now themistake that a lot of people make isthey'll say I need to find all thekeywords in a job description and I justneed to throw them in my resume and wecall that keyword stuffing that does notwork because people think I need to beatan ATS listen the ATS is a digitalfiling cabinet there ain't nothing tobeat you mind want to try to kick itdown the road but I ain't going to workso the reality is this when you apply toa position we use First in first outlogic so when you apply to a job if youare the first one to apply your resumewill show up first now when you apply toa job on the technical side of thingshere's what happens when you apply to ajob you apply to a job you basically geta profile that's created in theapplicant tracking system for you andit'll show the jobs that you've appliedfor so when I is a recruit go to pull upyour application it's going to show meyour resume and any other input that youmanually inputed the questions aboutlike your racial identity thing yourveteran status disability status that isactually not something that recruiterscan see that is information that goesdirectly to the Department of Laborthose just don't show up there are a lotof career coaches people who have neveractually worked in recruiting who willsay things like throw as many keywordsinto your resume as possible so that wayyou can beat the ATS or the worst oneI've ever seen is they'll say take thejob description copy it paste it intoyour resume and put it in white font sothat way the comp the the Bots can readit the AI can read it like no that justmakes your resume look silly like evenif you put it in point4 font that justdoesn't work come on that is not what ishappening instead of stuffing yourresume with keywords what you want to dois you do want to recognize what thosekeywords are but you want to Pepper themthroughout your resumethoughtfully for the human readerbecause it's a human that's actuallygoing to read and scan your resume truestory I once had a resume that wassubmitted for a marketing director itwas over 20 pages long two Z the resumehad all these keywords stuffed in theborder on the right hand side it wasthat was the weirdest resume I've everseen in my life let's just not do thathere's the secret to avoid the biggestmistake the truth is that as I was inthe process of editing my video Irealized that the secret that I gave youwasn't actually the best secret sohere's the best secret what I want youto do is picture this let's look at thisanalogy imagine you made dinnerreservations at a restaurant and you goto the restaurant and you sit down andwhen you sit down the waiter gives you amenu and the menu says stainless steelutensils Teakwood Furniture porcelainplates you'd be confused right andyou're confused because you think yeahof course you have these are basicexpectations because you're at arestaurant it's not like they're goingto go make food and put the food in yourhand they're going to serve it to you ona plate and give you utensils to eat thefood with and you see this a lot withresumés where people will write thingslike pays attention to detail excellentCommunicator works well in teamsremember these are just basicexpectations when you work in a job it'snot something that you need to put onyour resume what we want to do is youwant to think of the job description asthe menu that you're receiving so whenyou get that menu what dish do you wantto order so study the menu carefully andunderstand what that position calls forthen describe how your background isthat succulent delicious dish thatthey've been craving so don't sell theplate and the silverware sell the sizzleI just realize I didn't have my cameraon what\n",

my interview skills up soI'll probably start to work on that moremaybe do some more lead coding just justjust to get myself make sure I'm readyjust in case anything God forbidanything happens so actually what'sfunny is uh LinkedIn reached out to me Idid not apply uh what happened was is Iwas finishing my engering year I did aresearch internship in postquantumcryptography wow and uh uh it was waskind of cool and then what happened wasis I got reached out by an uh by arecruiter like oh you worked in cryptolike cool stuff uh we're looking forinterns apply and and I can give you ascreening right away and that's whathappened and I ended up joining LinkedInokay um that was 2021 summer and thenShopify after and then another companyand then back so it's a bit differentfor application um you have to writelike three essays It's Kind like acollege essay maybe the last time youever wrote an essay right yeah I knowit's it's it's definitely interesting umthey look at things like uniqueperspective grit I mean they're tryingto look at that non-traditional okaybackground so that's the first uh waveand then they have a technicalassessment which is it's not really Lecode style it's like you have to do a uhtake-home assignment and then you submitit and then in the technical interviewyou go over your submission and thenthey ask you to implement some new stuffokay so it's not really uh datstructures alos it's more just likeGeneral problem solving and some you dohave to be able to code um but you don'thave to know uh the same amount as youdo for like the Le code question got itand you've been in the program how longnow so I joined June 2022 and then I gotpromoted out uh in April last mon fullsoftware engineer recent so I was in theprogram for year and nine months now I'mfull software engineer but you do knowif you ever wanted to change jobs nomore essays it's going tobe yeah we'll see we'll see I I wasactually pretty good at leak code I feltlike like I think I just when I switchedI studied a lot of elak code so I feltlike my leite code ability was way abovemy actual engineering ability meanwhileI feel like a lot of Engineers feel liketheir engineering ability is above theirleak code sure but just because likeright when I started learning coding Ijust kind of learned through leak codeit's the age of AI everyone's kind ofscared of it have you been using it atyour job do you think it's coming foryours I don't think it's coming for myjob at this point I do think it'scapable of a lot of things but I alsothink it's you know capable ofhallucinating and we to kind of set upthe AI yourself so even if AI is comingfor our jobs there'll be more jobs towork work with AI um and I also thinkthat any company especially any techcompany but I think honestly mostcompanies if you have a lot ofdocumentation you're not using AI insome form to make the documentationeasily reachable easily searchable youare kind of just shooting yourself inthe focus

it coming for our job do youuse it at work are you scared of it nookay well why is that nothing scares memaybe that that's what it takes tobecome a s was part of you like maybe Ishould see what else is out there soactually I apply to two other places uhapple and uh Nvidia going through theprocess and then just realize thathonestly LinkedIn is the place for meyeah um what made you say that the teamhonestly my team is amazing just shoutout to my team okay to be honest withyou team is Amazing Project is amazingeverything around and the culture hereis amazing honestly like it'suncomparable like I do regret not takingthe Nvidia offer for the stock but otherthan that you know what Microsoft isstable so yeah that's true I do prettywell honestly like open a and stuff it'shard for computer scientists to get ajob these days how is it for not even inthe industry yeah it uh it's definitelytough and yeah it's tough all around umbut they Linkin has been really goodabout trying to keep this uh pipelineopen um it's not that many people it'sprobably we hire I think maybe like 20to 30 a year oh wow it it varies um butit is a really good opportunity justbecause it's so hard to get your foot inthe door as non-traditional and yeah soI'm really happy that they continue toinvest in this uh like other pipelinehiring pipeline do you have any advicefor someone who's coming in from anon-traditional background eventraditional and how to break into bigTech in this market I would say yeahdefinitely search for apprenticeshipsokay and uh just keep on grinding itkind of is a numbers game and the moreyou grind the more you learn um do somepersonal projects cuz a lot of it isjust solving basically got to pastinterview right right and a lot of theinterv is like have you uh had a problemwith this or explain to me how you solvethe problem when you have theseengineering projects that you doingyourself on your own then you're able tolike speak to the problems you solvebecause I imagine there was one time Idon't know you couldn't log into yourservice or or not even that but you getto create a login service or orsomething along that nature there are alot of problems you solve in thoseprojects so being able to speak to thoseand create a story around those arereally really powerful so internshipsare the way to go like I don't think weeven have new grad uh positions withoutuh internship so internships are the wayto go start early like start reallyreally early and don't worry about yourfirst internship cuz my first interestwas like an unpaid research assistantlike you I I don't recommend doingunpaid stuff but you know what like gotme here honestly so like I don't know ifI recommend it or don't recommend it butjust like see what you learn from itwhat you get from it and uh and doesn'tmatter like honestly a lot of peoplefocus on their first internship like ohlike I should get into big Tech get whatyou can do and then uh start applyingand go big after that but yeah okayobviously I was successful throughleaning into it so I'm kind of biased umbut yeah look for these opportunitiesfor non-traditional there's a lot of umother apprentiship programs around likeat other companies um yeah and I thinkcompanies are interested in likeinvesting in that non-traditionalpipeline so you don't lean into I thinkit gives you um cuz you can apply toboth if you're non-traditional so I Iwould say I would say lean into that andlook for those opportuni I could shareone success story recently so uh opensource contributions so actually so Iwork on a platform here at LinkedIncalled Venice we open sourced Venice alittle over a year ago and uh recentlywe hired one of our open sourcecontributors and they were uh fairly newto the industry they'd only been workingthink about a year um get out therecontribute meet people um folks areusually really eager to take yourcontributions and to work with you andthat can segue into a job okay sweet andI guess not many people have been at oneplace for this long so I guess when youstarted you were probably just softwareengineer sweet when I joined sweet andyou progressed up the ranks any adviceof how to navigate that at a big techcompany I guess like my best advicewould be be aware of your surroundingsyou know look at your boss decide ifyour boss can get you promoted decide ifyour boss is giving you work that canget you promoted yeah understand uh theopportunities that are in your teamright if you're working on a dead endproject well it's probably not great forthat and then this is just for fun youwere Premed thinking about medicalschool now you're a software engineer doyou regret your decision no no I I'msuper happy like I like I'll be honestlike any place that pays me just sit infront of a computer all day like I'm I'mso happy so uh yeah happy all aroundcool well I wish you the best thanks somuch thanks man Cheers Cheers so I don'tthink I've ever actually met a seniorstaff engineer what is your average dayin life look like like I'm sure yourwork has changed over the years whatwhat do you donow uh hasn't changed too too much uhmaybe more meetings than it before butotherwise you know it's coding it'steams it's seeking alignment it's stufflike that cool have you ever consideredgoing to management oh no I I've beenoffered but I definitely not I want acareer engineer okay cool there's aspecial link in the description oflimited time so do check that out cheers\n",

      "I work on PowerPoint I graduated from mymasters and it was like really difficultfor me to find a job my job title ismostly talking to the cxos of thecompany I've been running startups Ithink the most fun interview there theyactually told meto hey what's up today we're atMicrosoft headquarters asking softwareEngineers how to get into Microsoft andif they have any other advice to shareand you'll want to watch to the endbecause we found someone who is not onlytalk to the CTO of Microsoft but everymajor CIO and CTO in the entire industrywhat's your name I'm Sid nice to meetyou s nice to meet you how long have youbeen in Microsoft and what is your jobtitle I've been in Microsoft for about 2years and most of my experience has beenas a software engineer here at Microsoftyo what's up hey sup what's your name uhI'm Alex okay I just had my secondanniversary okay congrats so my jobtitle is software engineer to what teamare you on currently what types of stuffdo you build and what is your day-to-daytechnology Tech act like so I work inthe cloud and AI team a lot of my techstock is definitely based around C andmost of my day-to-day is actually goingtowards sort of quality initiativesmaking sure all our testing is in placemaking sure our code is robust andreliable and making sure you know Azureis one of the most reliable clouds inMicrosoft I work on PowerPoint uh myday-to-day is pretty much either it'sC++ which is the native side the desktopapp and then there's some JavaScripttypescript and uh C scattered around howdid you get into Tech like walk methrough with the interviews look likewhat you do in college maybe did sort ofthe classic we code grind prep forsoftware engineering internships wasable to get an internship at Microsoft afew summers ago and then just converteda full-time uh as a software engineerafterwards there were four interviews uhone after the other and they ended upwith my manager questions one of themwas like standard like leak code kind ofthing one of them was like they showliterally showed me a C++ P like a filefrom C CP file and then we're like Whatare the bugs here oh wow that's cool andthey didn't say anything I had to sayeverything did you get them yeah I thinkI got it hey let's go nice and I thinkthe most fun interview there theyactually told me to create a stokusolver sodoku solver yeah oh that's coolthat was probably my f most favoriteinterview question I've ever had nicewhat has been your favorite softwareengineering or Tech memory so farhanging out with friends taking trips todifferent areas taking trips to SeattleI think when it comes to like the actualcoding I don't think have any specificmemory that stands out but definitelysomething I really appreciate is just umall the kind of mentorship sessions I'vehad with more senior Engineers on myteam terms of teaching me the differentareas of our Tech stack and definitelysomething I I really appreciate aboutMicrosoft just having that inclusivereally collaborative community of growthmindset and trying to teach people howto best learn we got a 5-day hackathonand we pretty much like set up a wholefeature from scratch in that 5 days ifyou have any pieces of advice what wouldyou tell people I think I have fewpieces of advice here so one would bedefinitely like reach out to people inyour network about their experiencesinterviewing at different companies whatthey were asked and what questions thatthey would ask if they were to interviewanother candidate just to get that sortof Insider information uh definitely SlyCod a lot or any sort of interviewupside I think a lot of them are reallygood don't sweat it you'll get throughuh interviews just take it casually justtalk with them it's a conversation sodon't stress it do you see yourselfbeing at Microsoft for a long time yes Ithink I do actually I think there's alot of different teams within Microsoftthat work on many different products soeven if I decide I want sort of changein my career want to work on somethingelse outside of cloud um I have thatopportunity and I think for me it soundsreally cheesy but Microsoft is more thanjust the place I work cuz I come hereevery day my social life is here it'swhere I eat food it's where I work outjust got back from workout that's whyI'm a little bit out of breath um soyeah it's like kind of home for me so Idefinitely see myself here long term nowthe Microsoft engineer who's met the CTOand other industry leaders is rightafter this so don't go anywhere butbefore that I want to introduce you toan equally smart editing softwarewonders shares filora 13 and rather thanshow you some generic footage I thoughtwhy not just re-edit this video's introso we can check out all the featuresfirst we download the clip and are veryeasily able to see everything in ourtimeline we can then split it up to getthe the sequence we want and rearrangeeverything to our heart's content now weneed music but I'm really lazy so we'regoing to generate the entire sequencethrough Ai and that's what you'rehearing right here I also want somemovement in the shot so I'm going to usethe text to video feature to get somenew b-roll and last but not least weneed a thumbnail but I'm not sure how todo that so no worries I'm going to askthe AI co-pilot it's pretty easy you hitedit pick a template you like and thenit's done in general the editor is superSleek easy to use and packed withfeatures and with the affordable priceplan I'd highly encourage you to gocheck out wondershare's new Filmore 133using my special link in the descriptionnow let's hear from the Microsoft legendhimself what's your name I'm Rashid Mookay nice to meet you first of all tellme how long have you been in Microsoftand what is your job title I've beenhere 4 years and my job title is anarchitect Azure open a architect oh niceand then what does your day-to-day looklike today I got to talk to the CTO ciosof the Fortune 500 companies I helpedthem adopt like how to implement AI aEuropean Ai and that's my main role Ijust uh helped them move and adopt theright architect design patterns and myjob title is mostly talking to the cxosof the companies oh that's super coolwho's the coolest person you've talkedto I will say CTO of my own company ohreally of Microsoft yeah wait that's socool yeah so he he came here a fewmonths back for some of the town halland I got a chance to talk to them he'sone of the most uh like awesomepersonality and how he became the CTOdead Side Story to know and then what isone piece of advice you would give topeople trying to break into Tech or getinto Microsoft there's not one way tobreak in the tech mean tech tech isitself a big space right you don't havejust have to be programmer to become inthe teag you there's many differentroles you just need to write mindsetgrowth mindset you don't have to thinkthat what you know now or what is yourcurrent skill is what you have you canalways grow into what you want to doright so I think there's no one way andI definitely don't think that allprogrammers or coders or I think a lotof people get intimated especially theyoung folks that they have to sit insidethe cubicle and do all the day desk jobno no no that's a part of the job youhave tons of other responsibility heretalking to the customer talking to otherdevelopers and mean it's a whole it'slike any other job it's not like uh justuh the tech if you're thinking and whathas been your favorite memory in thisrole or previous role so far my favoritememory is in the previous role likebefore Microsoft I've been runningstartups I ran two startup as a CTO andfounder okay and I think that's my likethe best memories of entire my career doyou see yourself doing architectureespecially at Microsoft for a long timeor you interested in other things I havean entrepreneurial bug so I'm thinkingto do another startup maybe your ownyeah earlier I had my own startups tooso I was the founder of the startup thatgot acquired hey what's your name hi myname is David David nice to meet you sofor starters how long have you been atMicrosoft and what is your job tile I'vebeen here at 4 years uh my title isHardware engineer hi I'm myi I am anetwork automation engineer and I'vebeen working since like 2.5 years now hiwhat's your name hi Amy Amy yeah I havebeen at Microsoft only recently cuz Ihave come from an acquisition oh okay sobut I've I've been with that company for23 years wow and my title is principaluh technical program manager so you'rebuilding something what do you do tobuild it like what is your role runbunch of simulation so that it makessure is Heart Building Hardware is veryexpensive that we want to make sure itworks every time I don't know all thatmuch but the point it's got to work so Iwork in the Azure van Network so Ispecifically work on a system called asexpress route okay so where we likeprovide uh fast and reliable internetservice to the uh like to the users andlike mostly my day-to-day activities islike uh I mostly work on automation howdid you get into Hardware engineeringwhat does what do the interviews looklike what do you study what was theprocess get into the electri electricalengineering major for sure you just gotto be uh enthusiastic about it yeah yougot to be passionate that's that's allyou need yeah so it was like one codinginterview and three uh differentinterviews based on all the networkingknowledge building relationships okayrisk management when you have a lot ofinterdependent things going on how doyou facilitate meetings and how do youget people um to stay accountable andmotivated to deliver I'm usually justtrying to see kind of what theirexperience has been like and can theyCaptivate an audience if you will andhold the attention of a room and gettheir points across they have to be avery good communicator what has beenyour favorite like memory so far workingon Hardware stuff I was only worked onlike um test chips which is not realproduct or I was close enough to make itknow to the product yeah then it gotcancelled so I had no no I had nothingfor 8 years then recently I somethinggot something that is gettingproductized sure so I'm really excitedfor that wait that's awesome so thattook me 10 years to get the first onethat's actually about to be you know outthere yeah so I really like the eventsthat uh that are held over here so likewe had this friends and family eventthat was really nice that was a goodmemory yeah so this is the time that I'mBing with my teammates before that I wasworking from home so it was like no Idon't have memory from that releasingproducts is always a great memory Iwould just say mentoring younger womeni' say growing up uh in in the industryand uh getting people really excitedabout technology do you have any advicefor anyone trying to get into Hardwareengineering especially cuz you said youfelt like an imposter for a long timeyou you'll feel that the time there'salways genius I mean it's going to besame for all the industry but for somereason it feels like every time I talkto my colleagues they feel the same waytowards each otherso that's that's irony but that's how itis you're not like alone don't give upif you like it just keep trying you'llbe good at something that's going to beuseful I graduated from my masters andit was like really difficult for me tofind a job so I would just say uh to thepeople like those who are searching ajob like hang on there to prepare yourbest and give like give interviews andsomeday or the other you will land yourbest job and you will love it followwhatever works really well for you Ithink the big thing is when there'sproblems there's usually like there arepeople who are assigned to tasks andthen there's this stuff that falls inbetween the tasks like the balls thatmight be dropping those are the problemsthat nobody else is solving and if youcan just go grab some of those balls andlike make it your own that will be a agood stepping stone into figing out whatyou want to do next people love peoplewho solve problems and take ownershipwith things so that's I gofar\n",

      "they make us do six internships beforewe graduate I think focus on your skillswhen I joined it was full-time in 2021and at that time the salary was aboutwhere do you work what is your job titleand how long have you been there I'm atopum I'm a machine learning engineer andI have been there for 2 years yeah okaythat's my health insurance oh nice I'm asoftware engineer I work at Apple andI've been there about 2 and a half yearsnow including my internship first offhow long have you been at Microsoft andwhat is your job title I started at theend of June this here oh okay so about 3months yeah and my title is datascientist uh I work for landing Club Idon't know if you heard of it or not butand I'm like a lead engineer leadsoftware engineer and I've been therefor like 2 years what do you do nowadaysat Apple what do you work on what teamwhat's your Tech stack like walk methrough some of that we work on searchour search also Powers Apple Maps so wesort of fall under that department on aday-to-day we basically like half ourtime is like making sure it's up andrunning performing well up to speed it'slike apple so obviously like it has tobe fast you know but um half of that isthat and half of that is like developingnew features improving things like newiOS launch stuff what has been yourfavorite software engineering memory Ibuilt a project like in my masters itwas basically building a small minimumviable product of a search engine soyeah I have a good memory found there Ithink my favorite memory has been uhright when I joined like immediately asan intern I was put on a project webasically powered like the search engineon Spotlight you know when you likeswipe down on your iPhone and you seelike the spotlight bar yeah yeah so wemade like a bunch of changes to that andfully revamp that so it was really coolto like launch that as an intern andthen see like everyone worldwide usingthis thing I think when I startedworking as a full-time employee formicrosof this my this best memoriesbecause like I finally graduated with myPhD finally start to earn like you knowphds are underpaid like a lot of workand very stressful very depressingsometimes yeah but uh like I'm finallyjust uh end my student life I started mycareer so I feel very excited let's goway back to college did you ever internanywhere and then if you're comfortablesharing how much did they pay you andwhat did you build I interned at astartup called Compass red was an unpaidinternship it was mostly to getexperience out of from there so Iactually went to waterl probably heardof it so they make us do six internshipsbefore we graduate so Apple was my sixthone but before that I did five otherones yeah through all yeah so first yearI interned at Sony Ericson so the payfor that was like2 5 an hour Canadianand then my second intership I did atthis company called DNH and so it waslike banking software uh this was alsoin Toronto they paid around the same Ithink it was like 28 CAD just like aslight bump from that third I worked atLa Blas so we made the whole onlinegrocery app for them they paid a bitover 30 an hour fourth one actually wentback there okay worked there again fifthone Air Miles which is basically like aloyalty card program we basically workedon a system to make it real time so forexample you go to a store you swipe yourcardyour points are already in your balanceyou can redeem them right away that onepaid about 35 an hour and then my lastone was Apple they paid like about 60 to65 an hour something like that so nowyou're at Apple if you're comfortablesharing how much do they pay you howdoes the compensation break down andthen maybe what are your like yourfavorite perks when I joined it wasfull-time in 2021 and at that time thesalary was about total 180k and that waslike 130k base salary and then like 50like bonus stock and stuff like that soit came out to around like 180 and thenyou guys get like free Apple productsright or discounts get discounted Appleproducts so we get a personal discountwhere we get like 25% off on products wehave a friends and family discount so wecan get friends and family 15% off onproducts and then every 2 years you getspecial discount where you get like 50%off of the newest iPhone as a new grandmachine learning Engineers earn around145 and I think software Engineers I'veseen earn 133 or so like at a basesalary I feel when I started workinginitially I was like contractor I didcontracting jobs and 10 years back itwas 50 per hour and 60 per hoursomething like that and then it startedchanging and when I moved to Californiait was initially it was like 100 to 150kin the Bay Area and after that changedto 150 to 250 based on your experienceyou will get like more salary here ifyou you know look for a software as aproduct you look for those companiesthey will give you more pay becausetheir main investment is towards thesoftware what is your favorite perk orbenefit of Microsoft free food there alot of free food oh there's free foodfree breakfast free lunch and a lot offree snacks oh that must only be aSilicon Valley Park I think in Seattlethey don't have free food I haven't beenthere but I don't think they have andwhat was the process like like how manyinterviews did you do how did it breakdown and then why did you end up pickingApple I got the return offer I also wasinterviewing at Nvidia at the time so Ihad an offer from there so the choicewas between the two okay and I ended upchoosing to go back to Apple so it waswas just like the two interview roundsfor my internship just your standardleap code questions yeah that was sortof the interview process and I choseApple because I really enjoyed team Iwas on I think like who your manager isis like super important one of the bestpieces of advice I can give you islearning by doing and that's exactlywhat code academy is about in 2011 theybecame one of the first ways to learncoding online and ever since they'vetouched the lives of over 40 millionLearners their learning environment isgreat with course content the codeeditor and the code output Allin onescreen that works right in the browserthey have both beginner and advancedcourse content on over 14 programminglanguages and the entire curriculum iscreated by their in-house team of techand programming education expertsthere's a 7-Day free trial but I'll doyou one better the first 300 people tosign up using my special link in thedescription will get code academy Profree for one month now let's get back tosome more advice from Top engineers andthen last question do you have anyadvice to share for aspiring softwareEngineers or people just studying it incollege I think focus on your skills onyour resume and getting more experienceuh through through internships but Ithink on a bigger scale the projectsthat you do are very important that willhelp you finally like open source Ithink that's something that many folksdon't know if you want to be a softwareengineer I feel doing some open sourcework will definitely help you focus alot on sort of your side projects yourlike interview prep I think those arelike the big things for me at least whenI was in school I think I focused a lotmore on sort of like the stuff welearned in class and like not to saythat's not important like obviously youneed a strong technical like foundationand basis but a lot of the things thatdo on a day-to-day job or like thingsthey ask you in an interview are notnecessarily things that you are taughtin the classroom so when I actuallyinterviewed for Apple I did this likeside project thing where I basicallymade some like text bot thingy thatwould like text you every day a summaryof all your bank balances oh so it wouldlike it would look at your like ChaseBank at your Investments this that andbe like this is your daily summary andit would just like text to you and thatreally stood out to my manager like hesaw that and he's like you know like Iwas glancing through a bunch of resumesand that one really like caught my eyelike I feel like that's really cool andthen he like asked me about it so I feellike at least for me that project wassort of like the eye-catching thing thatlike got me the interview in the firstplace so I'd say focus a lot on thatstuff for me consistency is a key frommy master program to my PhD program it'slike after this assignment after thisfinals mid turns then you are done lotof homework in order to achieve that youneed to consistency it's like one stepat a time and at last you're going toreach your goal nice wellcongratulations you made it you'reMicrosoft that's awesome so whateveryour interests are concentrate on thatand don't worry about like a lot of newsoftware coming in and all that stufflearn the basics well I know actuallylast bonus question yeah are we friendsnow where I can get the discount yeah15% y let's go okay I appreciate it yeahwhenever you need it okay I'll he you\n",

impressivepart of our most impressive bulletpoints and we're just going to put thosein bold pop pop boom we are immediatelylooking better at a quick glance so herewe go from hiding our best stuff among awall of text to immediately grabbingtheir attention and the cool thing aboutthis is they are going to read thesebullet points first they're going to beimpressed and then they'll have a lensthat you are a high performer as theyread the entire rest of the resumepsychology now my friends on to tipnumber two again absolutely zero writingis requ by the way if you like thisresume template or this one or this onethey are all available on my websitealong with many others and some of themare free so here in step two we're goingto read every bullet point we've got andany chance we can add some numbers weare going to add those numbers in and ifyou're not sure what numbers to inserthere are some quick questions you canask yourself to help you find numbers toplug into your resume bullet points howmany times did I do this how much timedid this make or save how many peopledid this help what were my measurableimpacts and there's a lot of othernumbers you can plug in you don't neednumbers in every single bullet point butthe more you have the better the resumeis going to look so let's see what thosenumbers look like in our upgraded resumeW look at this incredible much improvedand once again on the psychology frontseeing numbers in your resume makes theperson reading it trust you more becausethey get a sense of your accountabilityas a professional and as a bonus thenumbers do an incredible job of showingthat you are good at the work that youdo and that is what this is all about myfriends so now we are rolling our resumeis already 50 times better than it wasbefore and by the way if you want to seesome samples of what a 10 out of 10resume looks like check out the linkdown below for my eBook The Big Book of10 out of 10 resumés okay now on to tipthree here we go and this one is thegame changer I told you about so underyour name or next to your name dependinghow your resume is laid out we are goingto add two professional titles that aregoing to be two to three words eachhere's what that looks like these titlesimmediately tell the hiring managerexactly what we're all about at a glanceand that is critical when we're goingthrough these quick scans that they'regiving our resumés now this part doestake a little bit of thought but I dohave a strategy you can use let me walkyou through exactly how to write yourown professional title for the top ofyour resume so just to get your brainstarted on what a title could be hereare a few examples that I put togetherthese all fit into a formula that I'vedeveloped that you can use super easilyso I'm going to walk you through thethree different ways we can pick outwhat our professional title is so thatyou can easily write your own so we'vegot three options for crafting ourprofessional title most of us are goingto be living and working in optionnumber three but just so you know youroptions here's number one and number twoso number one if you have a superimpressive job title as your actual jobtitle throw that in there we want tolean into that option two if you can usethe job title of the job you're applyingto and it will make sense as aprofessional title for you you can alsothrow that in your professional titleand what I mean by if it makes sensewell if you're applying to a projectmanager job and one thing you do in yourcurrent job is manage projects it'stotally okay to call yourself a projectmanager in that professional title nowoption three which again is probablymost of us we are going to craft our ownprofessional titles that make sense butalso make us super appealing to the jobsthat we're applying to here's how you dothat so when we're building our owntitles we're going to use the structurediscipline plus descriptor so GlobalLogistics is our discipline descriptorwe are a specialist or we'll flip thosearound descriptor and then ourdiscipline seasoned sales executivesimple as that here is that list ofexamples again as you can see all ofthese fall under those two categoriesdiscipline plus descriptor or ordescriptor plus discipline simple andeasy and you only need one or two ofthese on your resume to make itabsolutely amazing now if you don't wantto write yourself professional titlesbecause it's too hard listen to thisthere are two huge benefits to thesetitles number one it will instantlyanswer the employer's number onequestion who the the heck is this personand this is very comforting to them andit's going to bias a lot more of theirattention to get them to read the restof the resume and number two this willpsychologically color everything thehiring manager reads throughout the restof our resume under the light of aperson who falls under these titles ifwe call ourselves a project manager atthe top of the resume everything we dois going to feel to them like somethinga project manager did so in just acouple of minutes work and only a fewwords of wri we went from this to thisand when we only have 5 Seconds to catchthe reader's attention these titles thisbold and those numbers are going to makea world of difference this is going tomake us a 100 times more noticeable andit's going to lead to more interviewsand more job offers now don't forget

      "cageism is a real problem in the jobsearch and according to these studiesanyone over 45 years old is at risk nowI know this is not fair but we need tolearn how to protect ourselves fromageism when we're job searching andthat's exactly what we're gonna do inthis video we are gonna go over how tohide our age in our resume we'll coversome outdated job search behaviors thatmight show our age and we're going todiscuss how to alleviate concerns that ahiring manager might have regarding ourage in an interview and just so everyoneknows they are not alone it would mean alot to me and everyone else watching ifyou could comment a yes or a no downbelow to let us know if you've everfaced some sort of ageism at some pointin your career so how does one hide ourage on a resume well here is a resumethat needs some help so I'll walk youthrough exactly how to do this so firstthing we want to check is do we have ourbirth year in our email address if soyou will need a new email address nextwe are going to remove the dates fromour education this is something thatpeople will use to do the math assumingthat maybe you finished your bachelor'sdegree around age 22 so we definitelydon't want that in there especially ifit's not in the last 10 years or so andthen one more thing I know this one willhurt for some of us but we need to getrid of any experience that is over 20years old once we go back into the 1990sespecially we are really going to raisesome eyebrows around how long that weare going to be likely to stay in thisjob so I know this might be painful butanything from 20 years ago or more hasgot to go if you are enjoying this videomy friends and you're finding itvaluable take a second now to like Andsubscribe so you don't miss all of myawesome job search content that I'mputting out here every single week onYouTube now let's continue with thisgreat advice so there are a few morethings that we might end up doing in ourresumes or in our job search that don'tdirectly tell them how old we are butbecause they're old-fashioned out ofdate practices will kind of give them anidea as to our age page the first twowe're going to talk about exist in theresume the first one I couldn't evenbring myself to create a sample of thisbecause it's so painfully out of date anobjective statement we do not want anobjective statement in our resume thisis not something that's been relevantfor a long time instead we use somethinglike a professional summary the ideahere is to focus more on what we can dofor them as opposed to what they can dofor us the other little piece that wehave to cut out of our resume these daysbecause it is old-fashioned it's justreferences available upon request uh thereason being they know they know they'llask for references when they want themthe third out of date practice that Isee a lot of older job Seekers use iscreating a cover letter that is full ofparagraphs so as you can see theparagraph based cover letter on the leftthis is something we would see in the1990s 2003 what have you on the right wehave a nice well laid out scannablecover letter that is more applicable fortoday's hiring manager because theydon't have time to read a whole slew ofparagraphs they want to quickly we getthrough see what your best skills arehere see what your highlights are andget out so this is a much better coverletter for today's job Seeker now atsome point in this process the hiringmanager is very likely to meet you or atleast see your face over a video call atwhich time they'll have a better idea ofroughly how old we are now I have seen alot of people make it this far followingall the advice on resumes and coverletters only to fall short because theydidn't address some concerns that hiringmanagers tend to have whether they'respoken or unspoken about hiring someonewho is a little further along in theircareer so here are a few concerns thathiring managers have and once againthese are usually completely unfoundedbut it is helpful for us to speak tothem anyway so number one they'reworried they're going to put in all thiseffort to hire you train you get you upto speed and then you're gonna retire soin the interview or whenever we get achance to meet them we want to mentionthat we're looking for a place to builda satisfying fulfilling career thatwe're going to hold on to for the nextfive to ten years number two againalmost most entirely unfounded is thatyou are not going to be available towork regularly due to health reasons sosomething we can do to alleviate thisand I feel so sad we even have to saythis but it is helpful just mentioningsome physical activity or other healthybehaviors that we like to do whetherthat's yoga whether it's the fact thatwe're a vegetarian something that peopleassociate with health is just a nicelittle piece to put in their head thatwe are healthy we're going to beavailable I really hate that we have totalk about this it is so not fair thethird thing is that they are sometimesworried you're not going to be able torelate to and connect with the youngerstaff on the team now in my experiencethe most important thing that we candemonstrate here in this situation isthat we are willing to listen and we canhold a great conversation and engagewith the people who are hiring us sothis is something we're just going todemonstrate in the interview we aregoing to ask them questions we're goingto listen to their questions answereffectively we just need to show strongcommunication skills to put this one atease and number three they might beworried that we are not cool we are notup on the times we're not able to keepup with Trends the easiest way to putthis at ease although it seemsridiculous is to just dressappropriately dress well for theinterview so one of the things Irecommend doing if you have someone inyour life who is fashionable just askthem to help you pick out an interviewoutfit this will go a long way in justputting the hiring manager at ease thatwe are someone who's going to be able tomake an effort to relate understandTrends and and this will go a long wayto helping the hiring manager see thatwe are going to put in an effort tounderstand and stay up on Trends andthat is all we really need to do at thispoint now something important toconsider is that these tips and tricksare only useful if the rest of yourresume and cover letter are awesome andyou appear on paper to be someone thatthey want to interview and they want tohire so check out my other videos onresume and cover letter writing so youcan make sure your resume and coverletter are 10 out of 10 so that you getinvited to these interviews and canspeak to the hiring manager win themover and land that great new job I'llsee you over there\n",

      "greetings friends we are gonna walkthrough today the perfect 10 out of 10resume for a professional who is in themiddle of their career so we're talkinganywhere from really five years to like20 25 years into your career it kind ofdepends where you're at what you've donebut there's a pretty big range here andthis is applicable to more or lesseveryone in that range so let's juststart from the top obviously we're goingto put our name uh hopefully you have acool name like this but your your realname is totally fine then we want to hitthem with a nice professional title so Ipicked two here that I really like frommid-career that focus on the two mostimportant things that you need to beable to do at this stage of your careerwhich is contributing to strategy andmanaging people these are things we wantthem to see right away and associatewith our name which is why we put themright there under our name next we willdive in with a quick professionalsummary so again we're going to talkabout our leadership abilities we'regoing to talk about our strategic skillswe're going to talk in more detail abouthow we use leadership and strategy todrive things forward and make successfulchanges for our organizations for whichwe are working now we will also talkabout this is very important our abilityto collaborate with senior leadershipthis is something that we want to doespecially if we are looking to move upin our career anyone at the middle oftheir career should be relied upon toconnect and collaborate with seniorleadership at some point throughouttheir career Journeyokay getting into a little more detailhere obviously we've got our educationuh the years can go once we're about 1015 years off so this one is about due togo actually and then we want to get intosome career highlights something to kindof get them excited to see the rest ofour resume and give them sort of anoverview now either in the professionalsummary or our career highlights it'sreally important to Showcase how manyyears experience we have doing thisthing that they want us to be able to doso I like to at least mention that oncehere we have eight years of leadershipexperience that is greatcross-functional teams is a phenomenalkeyword for anyone in the middle oftheir career because most likely we'regoing to be either leading or workingwith cross-functional teams then ofcourse expertise is where we're going toget into again high level things that weare good at that help the company tosucceed so in this case Revenue growthbeing like a you know bottom line goalfor most companies tell developmentdevelopment is getting the people aroundyou to work well workflow delegationsame kind of thing but in a differentfunction then the most important partthe way we describe the jobs that we'vehad so you can see here we do have alittle overview under each job andwhat's important and useful here weexplain where we fall in theorganization so who are we reporting toand what are we responsible for and thatkind of sets the context for the bulletpoints that we're going to give themshortly thereafter now this is somethinga lot of people skip out on I wouldn'trecommend skipping out on this piecebecause setting that context is a veryimportant for someone to understand howyou helped the organization to succeednow another thing you might want to putin these overviews is if you do not havean employer that has a clear sort ofpurpose or function like we know Greg'sIce Cream Factory exactly what it doeswe know what Ariana's candy shop is allabout if you work for Nike or GoogleGoogle people know what that is but ifyou work for an employer that doesn'tsay what they do in the name or maybeone that people haven't heard of youmight want to explain that in our littleoverview section here as wellnow when we get into the bullet pointsthis is where we win or lose everythingelse we've done is to get people to readthese bullet points which is hard andwhat we want to do in this bullet pointsection is give them our bestaccomplishments ideally we will plug inas many numbers here as possiblesometimes those numbers are going toquantify our accomplishments as you cansee here we are reducing time to Valuewe are decreasing bottlenecks we'reincreasing customer satisfaction theseare measurable things and the moremeasurable accomplishments you have inyour bullet points the better because asa hiring manager is reading this theyhave a list of things they need to knowthat you're good at and these bulletpoints make it very clear that you aregood at the things you're talking abouton your resume so this puts them at easewhen they wonder will you actually beable to deliver if I hire you well youcan tell them here you delivered in yourlast job you delivered extremely well somost bullet points is where we can wewant to show accomplishments now that'snot realistic for every single bulletpoint don't put a ton of pressure onyourself in this example we haveprobably a few more quantifiable pointsthan others might have but sometimeswe're just going to share things likethe amount of people so we supported 30customers per day great we won acustomer service team member of the yearfour consecutive years again a greataccomplishment and then sometimes we'rejust going to list some more stuff thatwe did and that's okay as well but themore we can quantify our accomplishmentsthe better now at the middle of yourcareer you may have a two-page resume Iwant to put this rumor to bed two-pageresumes are totally fine especially atthe middle of your career entry levelsometimes we do want to keep it to onepage sometimes the company is going totell us if they want one page but almosteveryone should be creating a two-pageresume at this point and I didn't put asecond page in the example because you'djust be looking at more of the samespecifically more jobs because you'vehad a longer career now that is the 10out of 10 resume for a mid-careerprofessional my friends I would highlyrecommend you take a look throughI have linked to the template thatyou're looking at here down below thisis my most popular template I would loveto see
