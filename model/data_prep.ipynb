Whether you're a recent graduate navigating the job market for the first time, contemplating a career change, or aiming for that coveted promotion, the art of resume writing is a skill worth mastering.Below are some tips for resume best practices that can transform your professional narrative into a compelling story - from simple formatting to customization, optimizing keywords, upskilling, and more.Emphasize your skills and accomplishmentsBefore you delve into crafting or updating your resume, keep in mind that the focus of resumes has shifted significantly towards highlighting specific skills and quantifiable achievements. With the growing trend towards hiring based on skills, HR managers look for resumes that showcase candidates' abilities and achievements rather than just their past work experience. \"One mistake job candidates make is not including measurable results on their resume,\" said Cynthia Grande, Career Advisor and Outreach Manager for Office of Advanced Professional Education and Development (OAPED), within UC San Extended Studies. \"For example, did you lead a group of people, save an employer money, or hit a target? You want employers to see how you handle tasks and can enhance their business.\"She also suggests writing a career objective statement at the top of your resume that focuses on your value/experience and skill sets. If you're a first-time job seeker, you can even include school projects if you do not have work experience.Tailor your resume for each job openingWhen writing a resume, customization is key. To make your resume stand out, tailor your skills and achievements to match each job description. For example, if the job opening lists skills first, put your skills on your resume first. It's important to research the company and role to understand which skills are most valued and reflect those on your resume. \"The employer wants to see that you took the time to read through the job description,\" Grande said. \"Remember, it's not about having a long list of skills, but about presenting the right skills in a way that demonstrates your suitability for the specific role you are applying for.\"Use keywords for SEO optimizationIn 2024, it's more crucial than ever to use SEO (Search Engine Optimization) on your resume. That's because many companies employ Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to sift through and prioritize resumes using specific keywords. These keywords typically represent the most pertinent skills and experiences for the job. To successfully navigate these filters, integrate relevant keywords from the job description into your resume. This strategy increases the chances of your resume being noticed and selected for further review. \"Structuring your resume to meet the requirements of an Applicant Tracking System gives you the best chance of having it reach an actual human,\" Grande said. \"For example, if you're applying for a project management position and your resume does not have keywords for that career, you will get screened out.\"Keep the format simpleGrande said the biggest challenge job seekers have with their resume is formatting. She said keeping it clean and simple is the best way to go. For example, she said a Word document is preferable over a PDF. Resumes for mid-level executives and seasoned professionals can be up to two pages, while those with less experience should have a one-page resume. It's important to include strong action verbs in your resume, but also keep it clear and concise. And, don't forget to check and double-check for grammar and spelling errors. \"If an HR hiring manager looks at a resume and it has dates all over the place or can't be read easily, they skip it,\" Grande added.\" If you don't have a lot of work experience, you can include volunteer experiences.\" Meanwhile, she recommends skipping hobbies and interests on your resume.Consider upskillingIn today's dynamic and competitive job market, upskilling has become critical in crafting a compelling resume. With technological advancements and evolving industry demands, staying relevant and adaptable is crucial for professional growth. Demonstrating a commitment to ongoing learning through upskilling not only showcases a candidate's initiative, but also highlights the ability to thrive in a rapidly changing work environment. Incorporating newly acquired skills and certifications on a resume not only enhances your qualifications but also shows employers that you are proactive, resourceful, and ready to contribute to the company's success. Investing in upskilling not only gives your resume an extra boost but also positions you as a valuable asset in today's job market. For many industries, such as tech or sales, certifications are more valued than formal degrees, Grande said. She speaks from experience. Grande, a five-year career counselor, earned a certificate through the UC San Diego Extended Studies Career Advising Program. \"I gained a lot of insight from this course,\" she said. \"It has helped me in my career. Continued education and upskilling show initiative and growth.\" In fact, Extended Studies offers numerous courses and certificate programs for those who want to enhance their careers or even switch careers -- from arts to languages, creative writing, business, healthcare, engineering, data sciences, life sciences, basic sciences, and more. In total, Extended Studies provides 100 different certificates. Most individuals navigate multiple careers throughout their lives, and even those with a single career must periodically update their skills. That's why certificates play a pivotal role in career advancement, and it's something you can highlight on your resume. High school graduates can even opt for certificates in business, programming, or digital arts to kickstart their careers while contemplating future degrees. Extended Studies programs assist high school students in identifying career paths or acquiring valuable skills, like the Problem Solve Like an Expert program in collaboration with the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, which teaches basic programming skills. Even participating in a program like this before entering college or a career will most certainly make your resume stand out.Update or create a LinkedIn profileLinkedIn is incredibly important for anyone looking for a job. Grande suggests including a shortened LinkedIn profile link on your resume, and not a hyperlink, which throws off ATS systems. A robust LinkedIn profile can showcase key projects you have worked on or led. And remember, always keep your LinkedIn profile relevant and professional, because odds are if you're applying for a job, employers will review your LinkedIn, as well as other social media channels, Grande said.Use AI tools cautiouslyIf you have access to AI tools to craft your resume, Grande said it's OK to use them, but be responsible. For example, you can ask ChatGTP to help expand a sentence or bullet point for you but don't ask it to create a full resume. Remember to keep it simple yet customized for each job opening.Name dropGrande said the majority of the students she has advised have gained great employment opportunities through networking. Including referrals on your resume can help you land an initial interview. “For example, if you include the name of an employee from the organization you are applying to on the application, your resume will be moved to the top,” she said.Have your resume up to dateGrande suggests researching the job market for various industries to keep your resume relevant and current. There are a lot of free job market tools available, such as LinkedIn Career Explorer, and more locally to UC San Diego, the San Diego Workforce Partnership has amazing tools for college students, such as personality and skill profiles, as well as on-demand jobs in the market. \"Job market research will prepare you to create a stellar resume,\" she said.Create an elevator pitchWhen crafting your resume, it's a good idea to also create an elevator pitch to go with it, which is a great conversation starter when networking. An effective elevator pitch for your resume not only conveys your professional strengths and aspirations but can also align with the specific job or industry you are targeting. It can also engage potential employers, networking contacts, or recruiters by highlighting an overview of your qualifications, making it an invaluable component in positioning yourself strategically in the competitive job market. \"Having an elevator pitch will help you with your intentions on what you want to do,” Grande said. “When you're always intentional, it helps you in your job.\"Meet with a career advisor for tips on building a good resumeIf you're still stuck on crafting a resume for 2024, it may be a good idea to meet with a career advisor, who can point you in the right direction. Even if you're feeling confident in your resume, you can still have an advisor review it to make sure you are on point. \"The goal of a resume and cover letter is to be invited to an interview. It's like marketing materials,\" Grande said. \"A career advisor can look at your resume to make sure you are successfully highlighting your skills and what value you can bring to employers.\" Job seekers can also take a resume workshop to understand what employers are looking for.Resume Don'tsDo not include color on a resumeAvoid too many linksAvoid using online templatesDo not include your photoAvoid too many font stylesMinimize acronyms\"There's another trend I don't recommend on TikTok where people do a TikTok video resume that includes an elevator pitch. They are clever but not the most professional,\" Grande said.ConclusionGrande said job seekers send out at least 100 to 200 resumes when applying for employment, with the average interview rate being 2% - 5% for applying online. Crafting a compelling resume is an art that can significantly increase your chances of scoring that interview and impacting your career trajectory.Following the above best practices will not only capture the attention of potential employers but will also set you apart in a sea of applicants. Finding your dream job could be as simple as crafting a few carefully chosen words. Your new and improved resume will not only open doors but also lay the foundation for your professional success.Posted:1/4/2024 8:00:00 AMwith0 commentsCommentsBlog post currently doesn't have any comments.Leave commentName:Please enter a name.Email:Please enter email address in correct format.Please enter an email address.Your URL:Comments:Please enter some comments.Stay in TouchHear about upcoming events and coursesSUBSCRIBEWhat's your story?Share your accomplishments, advice, and goals for a chance to be featured.TELL MY STORYCourses & ProgramsDegree CreditInternational ProgramsOccupational Safety and HealthOsher Lifelong Learning Inst.Pre-CollegeNews & EventsEvent CalendarBlogSocial Media DirectoryMedia RoomCommunity & ResearchUCTV & UCSD-TVTeach for UsCalifornia Workforce and Degree Completion NeedsCenter for Research + EvaluationCollaborate With UsStudent ResourcesWorkforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA)​Veterans Education BenefitsRegistration Policies and ProceduresServices for Students with DisabilitiesTuition and FeesPrivacy PolicySite MapSign up to hear aboutupcoming events and coursesSubscribeFollow us today andget inspired!FacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInYouTubeCopyright © 2024 Regents of the University of California.

Start by accepting that it’s going to take some time and effort. Don’t try to sit down and knock it out in an hour – you’re carefully crafting a marketing document. Open strong with a summary of your expertise. Use an accomplishments section after the opener to link your experience to the job requirements. You don’t want to waste space upfront on irrelevant job experience. It’s okay to be selective about what employment, achievements, and skills you include; after all, you should tailor your resume for each position. Give concrete examples of your expertise, quantifying your accomplishments with numbers where you can. Seek input from a mentor or friend who can review it and give you feedback. Lastly, create a personable LinkedIn profile to complement your resume.PostPostShareAnnotateSaveGet PDFBuy CopiesPrintThe resume: there are so many conflicting recommendations out there. Should you keep it to one page? Do you put a summary up top? Do you include personal interests and volunteer gigs? And how do you make it stand out, especially when you know the hiring manager is receiving tons of applications? This may be your best chance to make a good first impression, so you’ve got to get it right.Read more onResumesor related topicsJob searchandCareersAmy Gallois a contributing editor at Harvard Business Review, cohost of theWomen at Workpodcast, and the author of two books:Getting Along: How to Work with Anyone (Even Difficult People)and theHBR Guide to Dealing with Conflict.

You do it because you need to pay the bills and chip away at that looming debt you’re reminded of with every monthly statement.You get an email or text from an old friend, former co-worker, or industry connection that you made years ago about a job opening with a company you’ve been discreetly stalking online for weeks. All you need to do is send over your resume or apply online tonight, and the job is practically yours.It only takes one look at your resume, and you feel defeated. You haven’t touched it in years. It doesn’t even have your most recent job listed, and its overall look and feel hasn’t changed much over time. You’re pretty sure it looks as ineffective as you feel after a long day at work.Then there’s all this talk online about ATS, AI, bots, and algorithms that will “kick you out” if you don’t know how to beat the system. Let me reassure you right now, this doesn’t actually happen.Resume writing is often the most dreaded task for job seekers because either:You have a difficult time talking about yourself in a resume,You have a hard time quantifying skill sets, and your edu-crastination (You like that?) has only instilled in you that quantifying your skills is the only way to get an interview,You have no idea what to do with your overly diversified experience or work history timeline issues like multiple company acquisitions, demotions, or changing job titles;The “dark cloud” of hiring technologies is hanging over you, orYou’re just too exhausted to work on your resume after work.Here are 24 actionable steps you can take to write a resume that lands more interviews and, ultimately, job offers this year.1 | Understand Your Resume’s Role In The Hiring ProcessThe #1 complaint from job seekers in the last five years has been, “My resume isn’t getting in front of the right people!” I get how frustrating, time-consuming, and often discouraging looking and applying for jobs online can be. Understanding your resume’s role in the hiring process is the first step to creating a job-winning resume that gets you unstuck and moving forward confidently.Granted this can vary depending on company size and industry, here’s the SparkNotes version of the typical hiring process:A team leader or manager realizes they need to create or fill a position and notifies the HR team.Someone on that HR team creates a job description based on the team leader/manager’s needs and posts it to the company’s Applicant Tracking System (also known as ATS) which is linked to the company’s Careers page.The HR staff member then posts the job to job boards as well as LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and other sites depending on their budget.The Applicant Tracking software collects resumes and applications from hundreds of job seekers, narrowing down applicants to the most qualified candidates using search terms and “knock-out” questions from the applications.The top qualified candidates (maybe the top 10) will have their resumes looked at by the recruiter or HR team who will have their own checklist of requirements and preferences.Out of the resumes seen, the top candidates (maybe the top 6) will get phone screening interviews.Out of the candidates screened, the top candidates (maybe the top 4) will have their resumes forwarded to that team leader or hiring manager to be considered for an in-person interview.Out of the interviewed candidates, the top candidate (maybe more depending on the hiring circumstances) will get the job offer.2 | Write For All Readers, Not Just BotsNow that you understand your resume’s role in the hiring process, you can see that your resume needs to get through an Applicant Tracking System and two other gateways before you are selected for a job interview. A common misconception about resume writing is that your top priority has to be writing your resume for computers or the bots that operate within ATS.Resume writing is actually a balancing act. You have to write your resume for three different audiences: ATS, a recruiter or HR, and a hiring manager or direct supervisor deciding who will get the interview.ATS is looking at both the digital formatting of your resume and the keywords you’ve included throughout. The HR reader likely has a checklist of requirements and preferences that they use as terms to search, sort, or filter through applicants, so you can’t assume this person will know that you have certain skills and experience based on your job titles. A hiring manager or direct supervisor will then need to decide who is the best fit for the job, the team, and the company as a whole among the handful of applicants that made it this far in the process.3 | Stop Fearing Artificial IntelligenceIf anything, AI is going to make it easier for you to land interviews.Most of the AI-driven features being used by hiring professionals are to write better job postings and improve communications with candidates. AI can also be used to help recruiters and hiring professionals find candidates on networks like LinkedIn based on search terms like position titles and skills—where AI branches out from these search terms to find candidates with similar position titles and skills. LinkedIn is also providing AI-driven features for recruiters that will recommend profile matches before jobs are even posted.Other hiring software, like Applicant Tracking Systems, have similar AI integrations. What’s most exciting is that some ATS have AI capabilities that will help gauge an applicant’s level of experience beyond calculating years of work history listed keyword placement. Instead of just looking at keywords, it’s looking at everything you’re saying in your resume and drawing conclusions about your skills and experience.If you’re providing enough context throughout your resume to show the results or outcomes an employer can expect from you based on past performance, AI will help drive your resume to the top of applicant lists.4 | Narrow Down Your Job TargetThe most effective, job-winning resume is going to be targeted for a specific job. If you’re applying for jobs online, this means the specific job posting. If you’re networking, this means you need to get laser-focused on what your ideal role is to position yourself as the best fit for the job that you want.Targeting your resume shows that you understand the goals of the role you’re applying for or pursuing in your job search. A targeted resume will also demonstrate that you can meet and exceed those goals based on your track record over the course of your work history and educational background.If you can’t narrow down your job target, you should either create a targeted resume for each of your job targets or consider working with a career coach.Career Exploration & Transition Coachingis highly recommended if you need help getting a clear direction and focus for your job search!5 | Design Your Resume For ATSThe next step is designing your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems. This software has been around since the 90s—so there’s a ton of outdated information online about it—but ATS has evolved dramatically over the last 5-10 years. Here’s what you need to know:Applicant Tracking Systems can’t read text placed in headers or footers, so be careful where you place your contact information in MS Word Documents.Applicant Tracking Systems can’t read text placed in text boxes, so avoid using these to organize information on your resume.Applicant Tracking Systems scan the text from left to right and often don’t read and store information formatted in columns correctly.Applicant Tracking Systems don’t care about bold, underlined, italicized, colored, or color-filled text so you can use these design elements strategically to make your resume easier to skim.Applicant Tracking Systems don’t see photos, graphs, or charts embedded in your resume (JPG or PNG files)—just don’t rely on them to convey important information that isn’t in the text.Applicant Tracking Systems can read PDFs but are known to read MS Word Documents more accurately—heavily formatted and graphically designed PDF resumes specifically often can’t be previewed in ATS.To maximize your chances of getting through ATS, start with a new Microsoft Word Document and organize your information in a one-column layout. Make sure your contact information can be found in the body of your resume rather than in the header or footer.Keep in mind that Applicant Tracking software is designed to look for certain keywords and text arrangements to fill in a form with your information within the software. Use standard section headings (Skills or Areas of Expertise, Experience, Education, Certifications, etc.) to make sure your information is parsed and organized in this software’s searchable database correctly.Related Article:ATS Explained: How Resume Screening Software Works6 | Use Color Strategically (& Conservatively)If your resume looks like every other black-and-white resume from the 90s, you’re not helping yourself at all. Your resume isn’t just a list of your work history and skills—it’s a marketing document, and color psychology is a key branding tactic used in marketing. Your personal brand, or how you want to present yourself to employers using both visual cues and messaging, is directly linked to your personality. Would you want to hire a black-and-white personality?Use color strategically to impact an employer’s perspective of you. Keep your resume looking professional by using conservative color for your name, section headings, and other design elements sparingly. Pick no more than two colors, but keep the rest of your text easy to read with a standard black font.Is the thought of getting creative with your resume design giving you anxiety? I’ve already done the heavy lifting for you and designed modern resume templates for college students and recent graduates, those making major career changes, mid-career professionals, and IT professionals in a variety of color schemes.Struggling to get through Applicant Tracking Software? These templates are designed to get through ATS and stand out in all the right ways when in front of hiring decision-makers7 | Include Your LinkedIn Profile LinkIf you’re not on LinkedIn, you're already falling behind other applicants. Why? Your LinkedIn profile is often the first stop during a background check because it’s an easy and free way for HR teams to validate your work history. I won’t even get into how LinkedIn recommendations on your profile are the new letters of recommendation…Related Article:How To Get Raving LinkedIn RecommendationsA LinkedIn profile also enables you to humanize your job application when it’s less professional on a resume such as non-career-related volunteer experience, side projects, and work-life balance activities. It’s your profile on a networking platform, so it should be more approachable and conversational. An even more important advantage is this: You can add more information to your LinkedIn profile than a targeted 1-2 page resume will permit.Add your LinkedIn profile link to your contact information on your resume and indicate at the end of your resume that more information can be found on your profile to speed up the background check and boost your application.8 | Remove Dates Older Than 2010Can you believe that 2010 was 14 years ago?! Unless you’re applying for a job that specifically wants 15+ years of experience with a particular skill (which is becoming less common for many executive-level roles), listing dates on your resume prior to 2010 is only going to age you… and not in a good way.Age bias and discrimination are serious issues that impact job seekers over 45 more often than they realize, but there are other negative responses to drawing attention to your age on your resume. For example, your extended years of experience may be threatening to a potential younger manager. The extended years of experience may also imply that you’re only looking to bridge an employment gap until a better-fitting job opportunity presents itself.The extended years can give the impression that you’re fixated on outdated methodologies, best practices, and technologies rather than present you as a forward-thinking professional.I often work with seasoned job seekers in their 50s and 60s looking for their last job before retirement, drastically changing careers, or returning to work after an early retirement. Eliminating half of their careers from their resumes can be terrifying at first but so rewarding in a matter of weeks. Removing work history prior to 2010 can bring focus to your resume and show employers that you’re more interested in the future than your past.Continue reading at offtheclockresumes.com...Help improve contributionsMark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.

Whether you\\'re a recent graduate navigating the job market for the first time, contemplating a career change, or aiming for that coveted promotion, the art of resume writing is a skill worth mastering.Below are some tips for resume best practices that can transform your professional narrative into a compelling story - from simple formatting to customization, optimizing keywords, upskilling, and more.Emphasize your skills and accomplishmentsBefore you delve into crafting or updating your resume, keep in mind that the focus of resumes has shifted significantly towards highlighting specific skills and quantifiable achievements. With the growing trend towards hiring based on skills, HR managers look for resumes that showcase candidates\\' abilities and achievements rather than just their past work experience. \"One mistake job candidates make is not including measurable results on their resume,\" said Cynthia Grande, Career Advisor and Outreach Manager for Office of Advanced Professional Education and Development (OAPED), within UC San Extended Studies. \"For example, did you lead a group of people, save an employer money, or hit a target? You want employers to see how you handle tasks and can enhance their business.\"She also suggests writing a career objective statement at the top of your resume that focuses on your value/experience and skill sets. If you\\'re a first-time job seeker, you can even include school projects if you do not have work experience.Tailor your resume for each job openingWhen writing a resume, customization is key. To make your resume stand out, tailor your skills and achievements to match each job description. For example, if the job opening lists skills first, put your skills on your resume first. It\\'s important to research the company and role to understand which skills are most valued and reflect those on your resume. \"The employer wants to see that you took the time to read through the job description,\" Grande said. \"Remember, it\\'s not about having a long list of skills, but about presenting the right skills in a way that demonstrates your suitability for the specific role you are applying for.\"Use keywords for SEO optimizationIn 2024, it\\'s more crucial than ever to use SEO (Search Engine Optimization) on your resume. That\\'s because many companies employ Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to sift through and prioritize resumes using specific keywords. These keywords typically represent the most pertinent skills and experiences for the job. To successfully navigate these filters, integrate relevant keywords from the job description into your resume. This strategy increases the chances of your resume being noticed and selected for further review. \"Structuring your resume to meet the requirements of an Applicant Tracking System gives you the best chance of having it reach an actual human,\" Grande said. \"For example, if you\\'re applying for a project management position and your resume does not have keywords for that career, you will get screened out.\"Keep the format simpleGrande said the biggest challenge job seekers have with their resume is formatting. She said keeping it clean and simple is the best way to go. For example, she said a Word document is preferable over a PDF. Resumes for mid-level executives and seasoned professionals can be up to two pages, while those with less experience should have a one-page resume. It\\'s important to include strong action verbs in your resume, but also keep it clear and concise. And, don\\'t forget to check and double-check for grammar and spelling errors. \"If an HR hiring manager looks at a resume and it has dates all over the place or can\\'t be read easily, they skip it,\" Grande added.\" If you don\\'t have a lot of work experience, you can include volunteer experiences.\" Meanwhile, she recommends skipping hobbies and interests on your resume.Consider upskillingIn today\\'s dynamic and competitive job market, upskilling has become critical in crafting a compelling resume. With technological advancements and evolving industry demands, staying relevant and adaptable is crucial for professional growth. Demonstrating a commitment to ongoing learning through upskilling not only showcases a candidate\\'s initiative, but also highlights the ability to thrive in a rapidly changing work environment. Incorporating newly acquired skills and certifications on a resume not only enhances your qualifications but also shows employers that you are proactive, resourceful, and ready to contribute to the company\\'s success. Investing in upskilling not only gives your resume an extra boost but also positions you as a valuable asset in today\\'s job market. For many industries, such as tech or sales, certifications are more valued than formal degrees, Grande said. She speaks from experience. Grande, a five-year career counselor, earned a certificate through the UC San Diego Extended Studies Career Advising Program. \"I gained a lot of insight from this course,\" she said. \"It has helped me in my career. Continued education and upskilling show initiative and growth.\" In fact, Extended Studies offers numerous courses and certificate programs for those who want to enhance their careers or even switch careers -- from arts to languages, creative writing, business, healthcare, engineering, data sciences, life sciences, basic sciences, and more. In total, Extended Studies provides 100 different certificates. Most individuals navigate multiple careers throughout their lives, and even those with a single career must periodically update their skills. That\\'s why certificates play a pivotal role in career advancement, and it\\'s something you can highlight on your resume. High school graduates can even opt for certificates in business, programming, or digital arts to kickstart their careers while contemplating future degrees. Extended Studies programs assist high school students in identifying career paths or acquiring valuable skills, like the Problem Solve Like an Expert program in collaboration with the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, which teaches basic programming skills. Even participating in a program like this before entering college or a career will most certainly make your resume stand out.Update or create a LinkedIn profileLinkedIn is incredibly important for anyone looking for a job. Grande suggests including a shortened LinkedIn profile link on your resume, and not a hyperlink, which throws off ATS systems. A robust LinkedIn profile can showcase key projects you have worked on or led. And remember, always keep your LinkedIn profile relevant and professional, because odds are if you\\'re applying for a job, employers will review your LinkedIn, as well as other social media channels, Grande said.Use AI tools cautiouslyIf you have access to AI tools to craft your resume, Grande said it\\'s OK to use them, but be responsible. For example, you can ask ChatGTP to help expand a sentence or bullet point for you but don\\'t ask it to create a full resume. Remember to keep it simple yet customized for each job opening.Name dropGrande said the majority of the students she has advised have gained great employment opportunities through networking. Including referrals on your resume can help you land an initial interview. “For example, if you include the name of an employee from the organization you are applying to on the application, your resume will be moved to the top,” she said.Have your resume up to dateGrande suggests researching the job market for various industries to keep your resume relevant and current. There are a lot of free job market tools available, such as LinkedIn Career Explorer, and more locally to UC San Diego, the San Diego Workforce Partnership has amazing tools for college students, such as personality and skill profiles, as well as on-demand jobs in the market. \"Job market research will prepare you to create a stellar resume,\" she said.Create an elevator pitchWhen crafting your resume, it\\'s a good idea to also create an elevator pitch to go with it, which is a great conversation starter when networking. An effective elevator pitch for your resume not only conveys your professional strengths and aspirations but can also align with the specific job or industry you are targeting. It can also engage potential employers, networking contacts, or recruiters by highlighting an overview of your qualifications, making it an invaluable component in positioning yourself strategically in the competitive job market. \"Having an elevator pitch will help you with your intentions on what you want to do,” Grande said. “When you\\'re always intentional, it helps you in your job.\"Meet with a career advisor for tips on building a good resumeIf you\\'re still stuck on crafting a resume for 2024, it may be a good idea to meet with a career advisor, who can point you in the right direction. Even if you\\'re feeling confident in your resume, you can still have an advisor review it to make sure you are on point. \"The goal of a resume and cover letter is to be invited to an interview. It\\'s like marketing materials,\" Grande said. \"A career advisor can look at your resume to make sure you are successfully highlighting your skills and what value you can bring to employers.\" Job seekers can also take a resume workshop to understand what employers are looking for.Resume Don\\'tsDo not include color on a resumeAvoid too many linksAvoid using online templatesDo not include your photoAvoid too many font stylesMinimize acronyms\"There\\'s another trend I don\\'t recommend on TikTok where people do a TikTok video resume that includes an elevator pitch. They are clever but not the most professional,\" Grande said.ConclusionGrande said job seekers send out at least 100 to 200 resumes when applying for employment, with the average interview rate being 2% - 5% for applying online. Crafting a compelling resume is an art that can significantly increase your chances of scoring that interview and impacting your career trajectory.Following the above best practices will not only capture the attention of potential employers but will also set you apart in a sea of applicants. Finding your dream job could be as simple as crafting a few carefully chosen words. Your new and improved resume will not only open doors but also lay the foundation for your professional success.Posted:1/4/2024 8:00:00 AMwith0 commentsCommentsBlog post currently doesn\\'t have any comments.Leave commentName:Please enter a name.Email:Please enter email address in correct format.Please enter an email address.Your URL:Comments:Please enter some comments.Stay in TouchHear about upcoming events and coursesSUBSCRIBEWhat\\'s your story?Share your accomplishments, advice, and goals for a chance to be featured.TELL MY STORYCourses & ProgramsDegree CreditInternational ProgramsOccupational Safety and HealthOsher Lifelong Learning Inst.Pre-CollegeNews & EventsEvent CalendarBlogSocial Media DirectoryMedia RoomCommunity & ResearchUCTV & UCSD-TVTeach for UsCalifornia Workforce and Degree Completion NeedsCenter for Research + EvaluationCollaborate With UsStudent ResourcesWorkforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA)\\u200bVeterans Education BenefitsRegistration Policies and ProceduresServices for Students with DisabilitiesTuition and FeesPrivacy PolicySite MapSign up to hear aboutupcoming events and coursesSubscribeFollow us today andget inspired!FacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInYouTubeCopyright © 2024 Regents of the University of California.

If you're applying for a tech position, you want your resume to represent you well, at a glance! As a tech recruiter, my work demands that I scour the web and read thousands of resumes a year to find top talent, so I have a lot of relevant experience when it comes to knowing what makes a certain resume stand out over others.When you’re thinking about your resume for a tech job, try imagining that you’re looking for a new book online. You go to the “best seller” section because you’re craving an action-packed thriller. A few titles that catch your attention so you click on the summary to see if you’re interested in buying any of the books. After starting to read the first summary, you stop halfway through because nothing catches your eye. What you might not have even realized was that the last sentence had a major plot twist that would have made you immediately purchase the book. A resume is basically the same thing! If you hide your relevant or enticing skills or job experience, a recruiter can miss it.Before I dive into my resume tips, let me just say that resume writing is an art and not a science. I regularly go to the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C. and don’t understand why certain works of art have long lines of people waiting to see a particular piece. Art is subjective and just because a certain piece doesn't catch my eye, doesn’t mean it won’t resonate with another person. Resumes are much the same way. As a company's needs change and evolve, a resume that didn't receive more than a passing glance today, could be the next great hire a month or two down the road. So make sure to keep updating and honing your resume as you pick up new skills, as well as applying to different jobs!With all that in mind, let me offer a few ways to make this art a little more scientific. Hopefully, my 6 resume tips will help you make your resume as impactful as possible!1) List important information and skills at the top of your resumeThink back to my point about the book summary: had the author put more relevant details in the beginning of the summary, they would’ve made a sale. Think about your resume in the same way. A lot of people will put irrelevant material at the top of their resume, which can take up a lot of space and doesn’t offer me more insights about you. In fact, it can make the recruiter have to work harder to figure out what tech the candidate is actually familiar with—one of the most important things when hiring a software engineer, data analyst or developer. To show a recruiter you are a good fit for the exact role you are applying for, put the most relevant information up top. I’m not going to say what is specifically relevant because this can vary from role to role, but I’ll outline a few options:Clearly list out the technology and tools YOU have hands-on experience with.I’ve listed a brief example below, but feel free to customize based on the role you are applying to and what categories seem relevant.Languages: Java, Python, JavaScriptFrameworks: Spring, Angular, React CI/CDTools: Docker, Git, JenkinsDatabases: MongoDB, DynamoDB, PostgressCloud: AWS Certifications: AWS cloud practitionerList what roles you are interested in.I wouldn’t necessarily do this first in every scenario, but it is good if you are looking for very specific roles or making a career change.Completed or expected degrees.I would only advise this for recent grads and students looking for internships. Otherwise, it can go on the bottom of your resume. I’ve rarely seen a specific degree make or break an application. If a tech recruiter is looking for a specific degree or university, they will likely keyword search your resume for it.2) Use bullet points, NOT paragraphs in the body of your resumeEver read a social media post or email and wish there was a tl;dr section? I’ve seen hundreds of resumes that are pages long due to everything being written in paragraph format. Simple bullet points will make it more likely for your key points to get noticed and ensure more of your resume is getting read through by the recruiter.3) Limit the number of bullet points you useNow hold your horses. Before you start breaking up your paragraphs into bullet points, I want you to think about if that line is an assumed responsibility in your role. If I see someone’s job title is “Software Engineer,” I can assume you’re writing/maintaining code. If it is easily assumed, you don’t need it on your resume. This can take 10 bullets down to 5-6 very quickly. Also focus on YOUR contributions and not what your team was doing. It’s cool that your team created a full-stack application with Vue.js, but if you didn’t touch any of that code, it’s going to come out in your interview. Here are some examples of helpful lines you can include below:Elevator pitch of the application you are working onKey user stories or projects you completedSpecific coding languages and tools you utilized in this roleAchievements or quantifiable results4) Add personality to make your tech resume interestingSome people who prefer the traditional formal resume will disagree with me here, but overall it doesn’t hurt to put some personality in a resume; especially a tech one. I will never forget the time I had an applicant with a single line on her resume that mentioned she built and ran an alpaca farm from the ground up. I wasn’t sure if her tech background was the exact fit for the role, but clearly I HAD to reach out regardless because she sounded interesting. There are a few ways to do this besides building your own alpaca farm. You can have a small section listing hobbies, you can put fun facts in, or you can list organizations and charities you participate in. If you are really confident in your writing skills you can put your personality throughout your resume (you might have noticed I’ve done this in my post if you’re not sick of my humor already). With all of these, the point is to give the recruiter get a sense of who you are and make them want to speak to you. You aren’t going to land the job because of these, but this will make the recruiter want to learn more about you. Now, the key with this is to not go overboard. I mentioned before, it was one line on the resume that caught my attention. It wasn’t random facts that filled a whole section of the resume or drew away from her key skills. I would advise listing these at the bottom or on the side of your resume if the formatting permits.5) Add personal projects, open source contributions and blogsOne of the things that excites me the most is when I see a github or stackoverflow link on a resume. Why? Because I can look into what you’re actually working on and see if you’re trying to tinker with new tech on the side. The tech world is always rapidly changing and new tools are continuously coming out. It goes a long way to show that you are trying to keep up with it and my tech teams always appreciate people who are taking that initiative. Teams also want to hire people that are passionate about things and passionate people are doing side tech projects because they love it. However, keep these off of your resume if you don’t actively update them. It’s great you had a github in college, but if you’re three years out and haven’t made any commits, it’s not showing me much.6) Don’t go overboard with style and formattingThis is another one that is going to spark a debate, but I generally advise not being too complex with style and designs on a resume. Use the tips I mentioned above to grab the recruiter’s attention instead of gimmicks. Also if you are applying to roles in the US, you do not need to provide a picture, marital status, or other personal information that you might have to in other countries. Your skills should speak for you and not your smile.Key tech resume takeawaysRemember—resumes are an art and not a science. My advice is meant to make this art a little more scientific, but just because 20 recruiters pass on your resume, doesn’t mean that something won’t grab the 21st recruiter’s attention. Keep honing your art and you’ll land that next tech job in no time.FacebookLinkedInInstagramYouTubeGlassdoorTech Jobs in McLeanView All of Our Available OpportunitiesCopyright © 2024 Opinions are those of the individual author.

Tech professionals are in high demand. But with so much talent competing for the best jobs, a standard resume won’t cut it. So what are recruiters looking for in a tech resume, and what’s the best way to highlight your skills?A tech resume should be more than a document listing your skills and experience in bullet points. With hundreds of applications to wade through, recruiters often only have a few minutes to get a sense of your personality, creativity, and ability.For tech-newcomers who have recently graduated from a tech bootcamp, your resume is also a chance to show off your transferable skills—and demonstrate how you’ll apply them in your new role.If you’re staring at a blank page, unsure of where to start, you’re not alone. So we’re here with tips, tricks, and examples to help you get your foot through your dream company’s door.Here’s what we’ll cover:Tech resume dos and don’tsBuilding and formatting a tech resumeHow to highlight tech skills on your resumeTech resume examplesFinal thoughtsLet’s get into it!1. Tech resume dos and don’tsCreating a tech resume can be a nerve-racking endeavor,especially for career changers. In the absence of years of experience in the field, your resume is often your one shot to convince recruiters you’re the right fit for their company.It can be challenging to showcase everything you have to offer in a one-page document, but a tech resume doesn’t have to be all-singing, all-dancing. It simply has to quickly and efficiently communicate what you bring to the table.It’s also important to note your resume often won’t even be seen by a human first. With the high amount of resumes being uploaded to job application sites, many companies rely on automatic AI software to filter the resumes before they go to hiring managers or recruiters.If your resume doesn’t include keywords, isn’t readable, or isn’t formatted correctly—the hiring managers may never see it. It’s a harsh reality, but it’s important to know what you’re up against before you start firing resumes off.To help get your application seen by the right people, let’s go through some quick-fire dos and don’ts:Do:Tailor it to specific companies.When recruiters scan a tech resume, they look for the specific keywords listed in the job description. To boost your chances of standing out, tweak your resume for each application and make sure these keywords are highlighted.Talk about tools.In today’s remote-first tech landscape, proficiency with certain tools is a distinct advantage. You’ll want to highlight your stack on your resume, and your proficiency with more common remote working tools like Jira, Hubspot, Asana, and so on.Get friends, family, and colleagues to proofread it.Nothing says sloppy more than a typo or grammatical error. Get a second, a third, or even a fourth pair of eyes on it before you start sending it to companies.Don’t:Have big blocks of text.Your resume needs to be scannable, with a highlights reel of your key experiences, skills, and the tools you work with. Stick to bullet points and lists—you canelaborate in your tech cover letter.Make it longer than one page.Likewise, anything longer than two pages is at risk of being disregarded for another’s.Make it too design-heavy.For new designers especially, it’s tempting to want the design of the document the star of the show. While a tech resume can certainly include creative elements, above all else it should be easy and quick to read—by both humans and AI software.Remember:If you get through to the interview stage, the hiring manager will use your resume as a reference point for the questions they ask. It’s crucial to highlight skills and experience that you’d be comfortable expanding on in a conversation.To find out more, check out ourguide to the recruiter phone screen.2. Building and formatting a tech resumeNow that we know whatnotto do, we can move on to actually compiling your resume.To make things as clear as possible, we’ll break this section up into two parts: What to include in your tech resume, and how to format a tech resume.What to include in your tech resumeYour resume should include eight key sections:Name and contact information.You don’t need to include an address unless the role you’re applying for is location-specific.Personal summary.This is 1–2 sentences summarizing who you are as a tech professional. This can include your title, the sector you’re currently working in (or are looking to work in), key skills and credentials, and an overview of your experience.Relevant links.Here’s where you link out to your website, portfolio, and any professional networking profiles.Relevant education.Emphasis on the relevant—no one needs to know where you went to elementary school! Stick to highlighting your university education, bootcamp programs, or relevant courses and classes.Tools.As mentioned earlier, highlighting your proficiency in the tools used by the team or company you’re applying for is a great way to boost your chances of getting noticed. If you’re a whiz inFigmaor aGitHubguru—highlight it.Skills.This is arguably the most crucial part of your resume, and what recruiters want to know about in particular. We’ll talk a little more about this in the next section.Work experience.Don’t have any? No problem: If you’re a bootcamp graduate, emphasize the skills you learned on the projects you worked on for your portfolio. You can also highlight work experience in your previous career if it’s relevant for the role.Other cool things about you.Your tech resume doesn’t need to be devoid of your personality; it’s a good chance to tell your potential employers some cool (but relevant) facts. Do you speak other languages, run a blog, or own a business? Include any noteworthy features that make you stand out from the competition.We know what you’re thinking: All that on just one page?Not necessarily. Depending on the role you’re applying for, you can sacrifice one section to place emphasis on another. What’s most important is relevancy.How to format a tech resumeGet the format right.A tech resume is more likely to be well-received if it’s a word document or PDF, but whichever you prefer, make sure it’s presented in the document type required by the uploading tool. Be sure to double-check the job description too, as this often lists a preferred format.Embellish elsewhere.Already noted, but it can’t be overstated: When it comes to tech resume design formats, the simpler and clearer the better. The creativity, storytelling, and design can shine through in your cover letter and portfolio.The differences between them can help shape your approach for each:A tech cover letteris a longer-form document than your resume (but still no longer than a few paragraphs) that introduces yourself as a candidate, expands on your relevant experience, and details your motivations for applying to a specific role.A tech portfolioshowcases your skills in action. It’s a collection of the real-world projects you’ve worked on that demonstrate your competency in your chosen field. Portfolios are usually embellished with videos, images, additional files, and so on.Both of these should be linked to in your resume, and vice versa.Use tools and software to spice it up.There are plenty of tools and software out there that can help you design and format a beautiful tech resume, likeCanva,resume.io, andCakeResume.But keep in mind that over-designed resumes will sometimes be automatically rejected by candidate-tracking AI software. Vibrant colors and branding are great, but don’t get carried away:a UX/UI design resume in particularneeds to be simple, clear, and quickly scannable.We know—it’s tricky to toe the line between a creative resume that showcases your unique personality, and a clear resume that cuts through the fluff to quickly communicate your value.But once you see how it’s done, your life will be a lot simpler: you’ll find some great examples to help you further on.3. How to highlight tech skills on your resumeEmphasizing your tech skills on your resume is vital. Ultimately, it’s these that recruiters are most interested in.There’s definitely a right and wrong way to showcase these. More than simple bullet points suggesting you’re proficient in X skill, recruiters want the proof in the pudding. Provide evidence of how you’ve put said skills into practice.There are also two different types of skills to highlight, hard skills and soft skills.Hard skillsrefer to the technical skills you need to actually perform the role’s basic duties. For aUI designer, this might be wireframing or animation. For aweb developer, this might be documentation or specific coding languages. For adigital marketer, this might be tracking and reporting campaign metrics using a CMS.Soft skillsrefer to the interpersonal skills that make someone a great employee, such as effective communication, project management, leadership skills, and so on. While the word “soft” might suggest these skills are not as important to tech recruiters—many of these soft skills are actually in incredibly high demand. Your ability to be a great team player or manager could be the difference between getting an interview and being overlooked.So you’ll want to highlight both your hard and soft skills—especially if you’re a career changer on the hunt for your first tech role. Thetransferable skillsyou’ve picked up from your previous careers will help you stand out among more experienced candidates.Here are a few best practices for highlighting tech skills on your resume:Quality over quantity.An endless laundry list of everything you can do isn’t going to get you noticed. It’s better to focus on a few key skills that are directly relevant to the role you’re applying for.Use the right language. Mirror the language used in the job description. Where possible avoid repetition of generic terms like “experience with” or “proficient in”.Provide relevant examples. It’s one thing to say you’re good at something, but employers want to know how you’ve put it into practice. Definite bonus points for real-world projects!4. Tech resume examplesNow that we know the elements that form an awesome tech resume, we’ll take a look at some people who got it right.Here are tech resume examples for five of the most popular tech jobs:Data analyst resume exampleViaBeamjobsWhat works?A clear, simple overview of everything a recruiter needs to know, in grayscale—meaning it’s far more likely to be accepted by resume-scanning AI.A career progression, which gives us some insight into Derek’s career goals and motivations as an entry-level data analyst.Specific projects that showcase Derek’s skills in action, with metrics demonstrating the impact of the work he did.To learn more, check out ourguide to writing a great data analyst resume.Web developer resume exampleViaResumeKraftWhat works?A creative way to display key skills and competencies, with bars and dots to break up the text.Richard chose a bullet-pointed summary for added scannability—a great move.The theme is bright and colorful, while still being clear and simple.

There’s a pop of color and a unique logo that showcases creative flair, but it doesn’t take away from the key pieces of information.Winona’s personality shines through in the “ask me about” section, but Winona has prioritized information—so it doesn’t sit above skills, tools, or education.UI designer resume exampleViaMockplusWhat works?This sleek, professional tech resume by Michelle Flacks is simple enough to pass through any AI software, but the effort that’s gone into the design is still clear.

The job responsibilities align perfectly with your experience, the company culture is a good fit, and the benefits are very attractive. You quickly upload your resume and hit “submit,” convinced that you’re clearly the ideal person for the job.But you never hear back, except for acourtesy emailthat says your application was successfully submitted, and you can’t figure out what you did wrong. Unfortunately, even the most qualified job seekers don’t make the cut because their tech resumes fail to make it past the preliminary steps of the hiring process.In the fast-paced tech industry, hiring managers and recruiters are looking for candidates who not only have the required skills and experience but alsostand out from the crowd.Although tech resumes aren’t so different from “traditional” resumes, learning industry-specific best practices will boost your chances of landing your dream tech job.1. Prioritize your resume sections strategicallyCrafting a professional resume isn’t just about filling in the blanks of a template. It’s about strategically organizing your information to highlight your strongest qualifications. With recruiters spending an average ofjust 7 seconds scanning each resume, it’s crucial to catch their attention quickly. The key is to put the most relevant sections at the top to ensure your most compelling qualifications aren’t missed.The optimal order of resume sections can vary depending on your career stage and the roles you’re applying to. For instance, recent graduates and entry-level candidates might want to place their education section before their work experience. However, seasoned professionals would typically do the opposite. This strategy lets you present your strongest points first, whether that’s your academic background or your professional experience.A good rule of thumb for tech roles is to place your career summary and skills section at the top. This immediately showcases your expertise and suitability for the position.If you’re a new graduate or changing careers, consider highlighting relevant coursework to demonstrate your knowledge and commitment to your field. Remember, the goal is to make your resume a compelling narrative of your qualifications, tailored to your desired role.Above is an example of a resume from a candidate who recently graduated with a chemical engineering degree. Notice how their work experience does not apply to their goal of working as an engineer. So instead of starting with their work experience, as many resume templates tend to do, they list their skills and projects first, which are much more relevant to engineering roles.2. Optimize your resume with keywordsWith the rise ofapplicant tracking systems (ATS), the rules of the resume game have changed. These systems scan resumes for specific keywords related to the job — if yourresume includesthese keywords, you’re more likely to pass the ATS and get your resume in front of a human recruiter.“The first thing that happens once you hit submit on a job application containing your resume is through an applicant tracking system. It’s entirely keyword-based, so the ATS will say a resume has X percentage match to the job description.” —Jonny Scharer, a resume expert and career mentor atPathriseStart by identifying several job listings for your target job title. Then upload your resume to a free ATS tool likeJobalyticsor Jobscan and compare it to these job descriptions.At Pathrise, we recommendaiming for your resume to match 45% to 65% of the job description— high enough to meet the threshold for potential employers without requiring you to spend too much time customizing your resume for every job application.To further optimize your resumewith keywords, incorporate relevant words and phrases throughout your resume, such as in your work or project experience, skills section, and career summary.Consider breaking up your skills section into different categories, especially for types of software like libraries, frameworks, databases, or coding languages. This tactic accounts for applicant tracking systems that consider this kind of breakdown while making it easier for human readers to understand the breadth of your knowledge.However, remember to avoid keyword stuffing. “Think of your resume as a conversation — you want people and application tracking systems to listen to the voice of your resume,” Jonny suggests. “Your voice can get louder by increasing the number of keywords, but you can also decrease the amount of ‘noise’ by omitting irrelevant projects or work experience.”Another tactic is to add a variant of a skills section where you describe what you’ll do in a specific role at that company. Below is an example from a software engineer’s resume:See how this candidate adds even more relevant keywords in this section, even for skills they don’t have yet, like leveraging a company’s current CICD pipeline. On top of giving them an edge over other applicants, this detail shows hiring managers that this candidate has clearly thought through how they will grow in the role.Adding industry buzzwords and keywords to your resume helps you get past the automated screening tools and increases your interview chances and hireability rate by 29%.3. Focus on impact and quantificationOther candidates will likely have similar experience and skills, if not identical job responsibilities, throughout their work history. Quantifying your achievements will set you apart from the competition while clarifying exactly how you will add value to the company.“At the end of the day, that’s what people are really concerned about: can you do the job? What results have you historically driven? Can you prove that you can do that for my company?” says Jonny. This shows recruiters not just what you did but the impact of what you did.A simple formula to keep in mind is “Accomplished X to achieve Y as measured by Z.” For instance, instead of saying “improved website performance,” you could say “improved website load times by 30%,” which gives a clearer picture of your impact.Let’s look at another resume sample, which closely follows the formula above:Compare “Provided the client with weekly reports and analysis of caseload inventory that helped management increase efficiency and decreased outstanding tasks by 53%” with the much more generic “Conducted weekly reports and analysis of caseload inventory.” The first version is much more specific and demonstrates exactly how this candidate’s work impacted the organization. This also helps hiring managers imagine how they will contribute to the company.Using concrete numbers to explain how you made an impact helps hiring managers set you apart from other candidates. It will increase your chances of interview and hireability by +40%.4. Use strong action verbsTo compete with other candidates, you need to get specific about what skills and experience you bring to the table. This is where strong action verbs come into play. These powerful words can paint a vivid picture of your abilities, showing that you take initiative and are proactive.Start by looking at the job description and identifying any particular action verbs. Then incorporate them into your resume to upgrade your bullet points. This will also help you avoid repetition as you describe your achievements in similar fields.As you revise your resume, think about the story you’re telling. Are you simply listing tasks, or are you demonstrating how you added value to your previous roles?For instance, instead of using a common verb like “assisted,” consider using more dynamic verbs like “spearheaded,” “directed,” or “initiated.” Similarly, “communicated” could be replaced with “consulted,” “reconciled,” or “collaborated.” You can find more ideas for strong action verbshere.The example above shows how strong action verbsmake a resume more specific and compelling. “Managed sales territory that grew from $2,600 in total sales to $1.6M in 2021” would be a solid description of one of this candidate’s accomplishments, but it fails to highlight how they did it and why it’s impressive.In comparison, “Established first footprint in new territory” makes it clear that the candidate was proactive in their job and succeeded despite the challenge of launching any long-term project from the beginning.Did you know mentioning “Team player” or “team work” more than once or twice has an impact on your hireability? It lowers your chances of interview and hireability by 51%. As it leads to confusion about the duties and work ‘you’ actually performed.5. Leverage your resume header and career summaryThe header and career summary are often the first things a recruiter sees when they look at your resume. By including relevant keywords and information in these sections, you can immediately show that you’re a strong match for the job.The easiest way to implement this is to include a specific title or role you’re targeting — for example, “Web Developer” or “Data Scientist” — in your header. This can immediately show recruiters that you’re a fit for the role.But don’t stop there. Your career summary is another opportunity to further showcase why you’re the best fit for the role. Jonny suggests a simple formula — say four things in four sentences:Who you are:Start with your job title and a brief description of your qualifications, such as “Proven full-stack front-end developer with 10+ years of experience creating responsive, dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript React.”Your proof:Describe a recent project where you put those tech skills into practice to back up your claims. Link to your portfolio or Github so recruiters can find out more without having to look for it.Where you got these skills:Mention the degree, certification, or bootcamp where you learned how to do this job. This detail provides context and shows that you’ve invested time into honing your craft.What your career goals are:Briefly explain what you’re looking for in your next role by combining hard skills and soft skills, like “Eager to join a detail-oriented, passionate team whose ultimate goal is the satisfaction of the end user.”Below is an example of a career summary that follows this formula:Notice how this candidate implemented the other best practices we discussed, like adding relevant keywords and quantifying their experience. Rather than having to scroll through the document to get these details, hiring managers get a highlight reel within the first few seconds of skimming the resume.For job seekers applying to executive roles, consider replacing the career summary with career highlights. This can be a powerful way to showcase the significant impacts you’ve made in your career. For example, you might highlight that you’ve “generated $500M in business over 20 years” rather than describing your career goals.6. List the tools used with every experiencePractical skills are highly valued in the tech industry, especially in startup environments where employers often expect new hires to hit the ground running. Adding the tools you used in a specific job, internship, or project provides vital context about your proficiency in these areas. Plus, it proves that you have hands-on experience, not just theoretical knowledge, of the skills they’re looking for.Mention specific technical skills — like programming languages, software, or methodologies — in the bullet points of your work and project experience sections. For example, if you list Python or SQL as a tool used in a data analysis role, it’s clear that you were doing some level of programming in that job.Looking closely at the software engineering resume above, we can see that this candidate included specific technical skills throughout their work experience. For instance, “Created a real estate website with scalability in mind that utilized Javascript with React Frameworks” says much more about this person’s mastery of this programming language than only listing Java in their skills section.It’s important to note that the tech industry evolves quickly, and new tools are constantly being introduced. Make sure toregularly update your resume to include any new toolsyou’ve learned to use to show that you can keep up with changes in your field.Make your tech resume shine with PathriseIf you’re applying to a huge volume of roles every week, you probably don’t have the time to tailor your resume to each position, so you need to start with a winning resume as your foundation.

Listing yourskillsis not the only thing that matters—choosing theright formatandsectionsis equally crucial. Here are some tips for writing a resume from scratch:1. Don’t try to cram every skill and work experience onto your resumeThink of your resume not as a comprehensive list of your career history, but as a marketing document selling you as the perfect person for the role you’re applying to. For each resume you send out, you’ll want to highlight only the accomplishments and skills that are most relevant to the job at hand (even if that means you don’t include all of yourexperience).This is calledtailoring your resumeand it helps anyone who reads it see exactly why you’re a match for a specific position.2. But keep a resume outline with a full list of your qualificationsSince you’ll be swapping different information in and out depending on the job you’re applying to, save aresume outline—or maybe ourresume worksheet—on your computer with old positions, bullet points tailored for different applications, and special projects that only sometimes make sense to include. Think of this as your brag file. Then, when you’re crafting each resume, it’s just a matter of cutting and pasting relevant information together.3. Ditch the objective statementThe only time anobjective sectionmakes sense is when you’re making a huge career change and need to explain from the get-go why your experience doesn’t match up with the position you’re applying to. In every other case, resume objectives just make you look old-fashioned or out of touch.Read More:3 Reasons You Should Ditch That Resume Objective—and 3 Things You Can Do Instead4. Put the best, most relevant information firstIn journalism speak, “above the fold” refers to what you see on the front half of a folded newspaper (or, in the digital age, before you scroll down on a website)—basically it’s your first impression of a document. In resume speak, it means you should make sure your most relevant qualifications are visible on the top third of your resume.This top section is what thehiring manageris going to see first—and what will serve as a hook for someone to keep on reading. If your most recent position isn’t the most relevant piece of your candidacy, consider leading with a skills section (such as in acombination resume format) or writing aresume summary.5. Choose the right resume format for youThere are lots of different ways to organize the information on your resume—like thefunctional resumeor combination resume. But the good oldreverse chronological—where your most recent experience is listed first—is usually your best bet. Unless it’s absolutely necessary in your situation, skip the functional or skills-based resume—hiring managers might wonder what you’re hiding.6. Keep it conciseThe two-page resume is a hotly debated topic, but the bottom line is this—you want the information here to be as short as possible, and keeping it to one page forces you to prioritize what really matters. If you truly have enough relevant and important experience, training, and credentials to showcase on more than one page of your resume, then go for two. But if you can tell the same story in less space? Do it.Read More:6 Pro Tips for Cutting Your Resume Down to One Page7. Include relevant linksCan’t figure out how to tell your whole story on one page, or want to be able to include some visual examples of your work? Instead of trying to have your resume cover everything, cover the most important details on that document. Then, include a link to yourpersonal website, youronline portfolio, examples of your work, or a relevant,professional social media profile, where you can dive more into what makes you the ideal candidate.Just avoid hyperlinking over words that are key to understanding your resume, since it can throw off the tools employers use to store and parse resumes.8. Be aware of the ATSYou may have heard that employers are using computers to “read” your resume and decide who to hire and reject. That’s not exactly true. But most employers do use software called an applicant tracking system—or ATS—to parse resumes and organize them so that recruiters and hiring managers can search for the most relevant applications.You should assume your resume will pass through an ATS at some point during your job search, so understanding how it works will help make your hunt more efficient. (All of the tips for resume writing in this list keep ATSs in mind as well!)Read More:Beat the Robots: How to Get Your Resume Past the System and Into Human HandsResume formatting tipsYour resume\\'s format matters as much as the content it holds. Aim for a simple and minimalist layout, without overwhelming columns, colors, or graphic elements. Here are some key resume formatting tips to help you stand out:9. Keep your resume format simpleWe’ll talk about getting creative in order to stand out in a minute. But the most basic principle of good resume formatting and design? Keep it simple. Make your resume easy on hiring managers’ eyes by using a reasonably sized default font like Helvetica or Arial and leaving a healthy amount ofwhite spaceon the page. Your main focus here should be on readability for the hiring manager (and that pesky ATS).Read more:The Best Resume Font and Size (No More Agonizing!)10. Stand out with ATS-friendly design elementsReally want your resume to stand out from the sea of Times New Roman? Yes,creative resumes—like infographics, videos, or presentations can set you apart, but you have to make sure they actually get read. If you’re uploading your resume to a job application site or online portal, use ATS-friendly formatting elements like:Bold and italic textUnderlining (in headings or over hyperlinks)ColorsBulletsDifferent text alignmentsColumns that can be read straight across11. Avoid design elements that can’t be “read” by computersOn the flip side, it’s best to avoid design elements that ATSs are known to have trouble with such as:TablesText boxesLogos and iconsImages and photosGraphics, graphs, or other visualsHeaders and footersLess common fontsColumns that can only be read from top to bottom12. Make your contact info prominentYou don’t need to include youraddress on your resumeanymore (really!), but you do need to make sure to include a phone number and professional-sounding email address (but not one affiliated with another job!) as well as other places the hiring manager can find you on the web, like your LinkedIn profile, plus yourpronounsif you’d like to.Read More:Here\\'s Exactly What Should Be Included in Your Resume\\'s Header13. Design your resume for skimmabilityYou’ve probably heard before that hiring managers don’t spend a lot of time on each individual resume. So help them get as much information as possible in as little time as possible, by making yourresume easy to skim.Work experience resume tipsRecruiters nowadays want to know more than a simple description of your responsibilities. They\\'re looking for the results and impacts of your work, as well as the connection between your experience and the position you\\'re applying for now.That said, let\\'s take a look at some resume writing tips for describing your work experience:14. Keep your work experience recent and relevantAs a rule, you should only show the most recent10-15 years of your careerand only include the experiences that are relevant to the positions you’re applying to. Remember to allocate real estate on your resume according to importance. If there’s a choice between including one more college internship or going into more detail about your current role, always choose the latter (unless the internship was more relevant to the role you’re applying for).15. Don’t forget your transferable skills and experiencesDon’t panic if you don’t have any professional experience that fits the bill. Focus your resume on your relevant andtransferable skillsalong with any related side or academicprojects, and then make sure to pair it with a strongcover lettertelling the narrative of why you’re ideal for the job.Read more:What to Put on Your Resume When You Have No Relevant Work Experience16. Write strong, achievement-focused bullet pointsThe bullet points under each job entry are arguably the most important part of your resume. They tell whoever’s reading it what skills you have, how you’ve used them, and how you’ve helped your employers in the past.So start with a strongaction verb, include relevant skills from thejob description, and frame your bullets around your achievements—don’t just list yourjob duties. Tell them how your work benefitted your boss or company so they know what they stand to gain by hiring you.Here’s a simple formula to follow:Compelling verb + job duty + key skills used = tangible resultSo you might say: “Developed an upgrade to the employee database, ensuring the smooth flow of critical operations, which led to a 35% increase in efficiency.”17. Curate your bullet points and experiencesNo matter how long you’ve been in a job, or how much you’ve accomplished there, you shouldn’t have more than eight bullet points under it—and that’s only for your most recent and relevant job. Jobs further back should generally be limited to four to six bullets.Read More:How Many Bullet Points Should Each Job on Your Resume Have?18. Use as many numbers as you canUse facts, figures, and numbers whenever possible in your bullet points. How many people were impacted by your work? By what percentage did you exceed your goals? Quantifying your accomplishments allows the hiring manager to picture the level of work or responsibility you needed to achieve them.19. Don’t neglect non-traditional workThere’s no law that says you can only put full-time or paid work on your resume. So, if you’vevolunteered, worked part-time or asa temporary or contract worker, freelanced, or interned? Absolutely list these things as their own “jobs” within your career chronology—as long as they’re relevant to the job you’re applying for. The same goes forcareer breaks. Yes, really.Read More:4 Things You Didn\\'t Know You Could Put on Your Resume20. Use important keywords from the job descriptionScan the job description, see what words are used most often, and make sure you’ve included them in your bullet points. For example, does the job description list “CRM” or “Salesforce”? Make sure your resume matches. Not only is this a self-check that you’re targeting your resume to the job, but it’ll also make it easier to search for your resume in an ATS.Read More:How to Pick Resume Keywords That\\'ll Get Your Job Application Past the ATSResume tips for including your educationMost hiring managers will want to know your education level, even if it\\'s not necessarily relevant to the position you\\'re going for. This section is especially important for those changing careers or applying for entry-level jobs—as your education can be an indicator of the skills you have.Here\\'s some resume tips and tricks for this section:21. Put experience first, education laterUnless you’re arecent graduate, put your education after your experience. Chances are, your last couple of jobs are more important and relevant to you getting the job than where you went to college.22. Also keep it in reverse chronological orderGenerally, you should list your educational background with the most recent or advanced degree first, working in reverse chronological order. But if older coursework is more specific to the job, list that first to grab the reviewer’s attention.23. Remove the dates from your education section once you’re a few years into your careerUnless you’re early in your career, don’t list your graduation dates. The reviewer cares more about whether or not you have the degree than when you earned it. And you don’t want to inadvertently open yourself up toage discrimination, which is an unfortunate reality in some job markets.24. Highlight honors and achievements, not GPAIf you graduated from college with high honors, absolutely make note of it. Showcase that summa cum laude status, the fact that you were in the honors college at your university, a relevant project you completed, or an award you won. You don’t need to list yourGPA—employers don’t care as much about GPA as they do what skills you gained in school.Read More:How to (and How Not to) List Education on Your Resume25. Include continuing or online educationFeel free to include continuing education, professional development coursework, oronline coursesin your education section, especially if your resume feels a little light on relevant experience.Best resume tips for showing off your skillsYou shouldn\\'t wait until you get aninterviewto showcase your skills—your resume can and should have a specific section for them. You can also leverage other sections of the document to incorporate what\\'s relevant for the position.Here are our tips for making a resume that effectively highlights your skills:26. Don’t forget your skills sectionBe sure to add a section that lists all the relevant skills you have for a position—especially those mentioned in the job description. Includetechnical skillslike software and project management tools or specific knowledge of how to perform relevant tasks. Just make sure to skip including skills that everyone is expected to have, like using email or Microsoft Word. Doing so will make you seemlesstechnologically savvy.27. But don’t only put your skills in your skills sectionYour skills section is an easy way for anyone reading your resume to confirm that you have required qualifications, but that shouldn’t be the only place that your important skills appear. Any skill that’s vital to you being hired should also be in your bullet points—where you can show how you’ve used it in the past.28. Divvy up your skills for readabilityIf you have lots of skills that would help you with a job but aren’t necessarily in the same category—say, foreign language, software, and leadership skills—try breaking up your skills sections. Below your “Skills” section, add a subsection titled “Language Skills” or “Software Skills,” for example. Again, we’re going for skimmability here!29. Show—don’t tell—your soft skillsDescribingsoft skillson a resume often starts to sound like a list of meaningless buzzwords. But being a “strong leader” or an “effective communicator” are important characteristics you want to get across. Think about how you can demonstrate these attributes in your bullet points without actually saying them.Read more:The Non-Boring Way to Show Off Your Soft Skills in Your Job SearchOther resume section tipsResume sections are not fixed like stone-written texts; they can change according to the job position you\\'re applying for or the requirements listed by the company. Here are some examples of sections you can add—and more tips on writing a resume that stand out:30. Include relevant certifications and licensesIf you have acertification or licensethat proves you can do some aspect of the job you’re applying for, include it on your resume. This is especially important if that certification or license is legally required to do the job—for example, in nursing, teaching, or driving jobs.31. Show some (relevant) personalityFeel free to include an “Interests” section on your resume, but only add those that are relevant to the job. Are you a guitar player with your eye on a music company? Definitely include it. But if you’re considering including your scrapbooking hobby for a software developer job at a healthcare company? Best to leave it out.32. Beware of interests and activities that could be controversialMaybe you help raise money for your church on the reg. Or perhaps you’re dedicated to canvassing during political campaigns. Yes, these experiences show a good amount of work ethic or possibly other relevant skills—but they could also open you up to be discriminated against by someone who disagrees with the cause. So weigh your decision to include them carefully.33. Add awards and achievements—when they’re relevantDo include awards and accolades you’ve received, even if they’re company-specific awards. Just state what you earned them for, e.g., “Earned Golden Salesperson Award for having the company’s top sales record four quarters in a row.” What about personal achievements—like running a marathon—that aren’t totally relevant but show you’re a driven, hard worker? Consider thebest way to include them(and if you should).Resume tips for navigating employment gaps and other sticky situationsIf you\\'re an experienced professional, you might have some tricky information to explain. Job hopping, career gap, and short term jobs are examples of things that can make an applicant feel insecure when drafting resumes.Is that your situation? Check on these good resume tips to explain sticky situations without jeopardizing your chances to get an interview:34. Cut the short-term jobsIf you stayed at a (non-temporary) job for only a matter of months, consider eliminating it from your resume to avoid looking like a job hopper. Leaving a particularly short-lived job or two off your resume shouldn’t hurt, as long as you’re honest about your experience if asked in an interview. But if the short-term job is super relevant to this job, consider including it anyway.35. If you have shorter gaps, be strategic about how you list datesIf you have gaps of a few months in your work history, don’t list the usual start and end dates with months and years for each position. Use years only (2018–2020), or just the number of years or months you worked at each position. Just keep it consistent throughout your resume and don’t lie if asked about gaps during an interview.Read more:How to Explain the Gap in Your Resume With Ease36. Explain serial job hoppingIf you’ve job-hopped frequently, you can include a succinct reason for leaving next to each position like “company closed,” “layoff due to downsizing,” or “relocated to a new city.” By addressing the gaps, you’ll proactively illustrate the reason for your frequent job movement and make it less of an issue.37. Explain a long break in jobsRe-entering the workforce after a long hiatus? This is the perfect opportunity for a summary statement at the top, outlining your best skills and accomplishments. Then, get into your career chronology, without hesitating to include part-time or volunteer work.38. Be intentional about career gapsWhile career gaps are becoming increasingly common, you should still frame them in a way that’s relevant to a future employer, by talking about skills you gained or any professional endeavors you took on. If you didn’t focus on professional development, that’s fine too! But not every employer will appreciate it if you get too cutesy about that section of your resume.For example, if you took time out of the workforce to raise kids, you might not want to creatively describe this parenting experience on your resume, à la “adeptly managed the growing pile of laundry.” Instead state what you did plainly and include any professional skills you may have grown or activities you may have done.Read More:Stay-at-Home Parent? How to Kill it on Your Comeback ResumeTips on resume finishing touchesWriting a good resume alone isn\\'t the only thing that matters. How you save and send it can also determine whether the recruiter will even take a look at it. To wrap things up, here are our resume formatting tips and other suggestions to boost your chances of getting noticed:39. Ditch “References available upon request”If a hiring manager is interested in you, they’ll ask you for references—and will assume that you have them. There’s no need to address the obvious (and doing so might even make you look a little out of touch!).40. Proofread, proofread, proofreadIt should go without saying, but fully edit your resume and make sure it’s free and clear of typos. And don’t rely on spell check and grammar check alone—step away for a few hours, then read your resume closely again, and ask family or friends to take a look at it for you.41. Save it as a PDF or Word documentUnless a job posting specifically requests that you do otherwise, your resume should always be submitted as either aPDF or Word document(.docx not .doc). These are the formats that can be most easily opened and most easily parsed by an ATS.The choice between the two is up to you (again, unless the company you’re applying to requests one format over the other). If you’re emailing your resume, however, PDFs are a bit more likely to maintain your formatting across different computers and programs.42. Name your file clearlyReady to save your resume and send it off? Save it as “Jane Smith Resume” instead of “Resume.” The hiring manager is going to have plenty of “Resumes” on their computer, so make it super easy for them to find what they’re looking for. You can even go a bit further and put the position title in your file name (e.g., “Jane Smith Marketing Analyst Resume).Read More:The (Simple) Guidelines You Should Follow When Naming Your Resume and Cover Letter Files43. Keep your resume outline freshCarve out some time every quarter or so to pull up your resume outline and make some updates. Have you taken on new responsibilities? Learned new skills? Add them. When your resume is updated on a regular basis, you’re always ready to pounce when opportunity presents itself. And even if you’re not job searching, there areplenty of good reasonsto keep this document in tip-top shape.The Muse LogoA logo with \"the muse\" in white text.© 2024 Daily Muse Inc.About The MuseAbout UsCareersFAQsContact UsSearch JobsBrowse CompaniesTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyPopular JobsNew York JobsSan Francisco JobsSeattle JobsEngineering JobsMarketing JobsInformation Technology JobsSalariesSearch Job TitlesGet InvolvedFor EmployersFor PartnersThe Muse Book: The New Rules of WorkPodcast: The New Rules of WorkFor Career CoachesSend Feedback About The MuseTell A FriendJoin The ConversationFacebookLinkedInTwitterPinterestInstagram', '70 Accomplishments to Add to Your Resume—and How | The MuseSkip to main contentThe Muse LogoA logo with &quat;the muse&quat; in dark blue text.JobsAccount ManagementAccounting and FinanceAdministration and OfficeAdvertising and MarketingArtsBusiness OperationsComputer and ITCustomer ServiceData and AnalyticsDesign and UXEducationHealthcareHuman Resources and RecruitmentManagementMedia, PR, and CommunicationsProduct ManagementProject ManagementSalesSoftware EngineeringWriting and EditingView All JobsCompaniesAdviceCoachingEmployersSign InSaved CompaniesAccount SettingsSign OutJob SearchFinding a JobResumesResume ExamplesCover LettersNetworkingInterviewingJob OfferView all in Job Search >Career PathsExploring CareersCareers in Data and AnalyticsCareers in FinanceCareers in MarketingCareers in SalesCareers in Software EngineeringCareer StoriesCareer ChangeTraining and DevelopmentView all in Career Paths >Succeeding at WorkWork and COVID-19ProductivityGetting AheadWork RelationshipsWork-Life BalanceWorking ParentsRemote WorkMoneyChanging JobsManagementBreak RoomView all in Succeeding at Work >Diversity and InclusionAnti-Racism at WorkLGBTQ at WorkDisability and WorkGender and WorkView all in Diversity and Inclusion >MoreVideosJob Search VideosCareer Advice VideosCareer Story VideosCompany Spotlight VideosIndustry Spotlight VideosEmployer ResourcesAdvice/Job Search/ResumesForget Job Duties—Add Accomplishments to Your Resume to Land the JobbyRegina BorsellinoUpdated3/1/2023FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailBailey Zelena; fizkes/Getty ImagesPut yourself in the shoes of someone looking for a new office manager for a second.

It tells you not only what that person has done, but also how well they’ve done it and what kinds of tools they’re familiar with.So why the hell are you still listing your job duties? Here’s how to list your accomplishments on a resume instead in a way that’ll show off what you can really do—plus examples!Why you should include achievements and accomplishments on your resumeWhen you apply to a job, chances are you’re not the only applicant who’s qualified. You’re not the only applicant with experiences and skills that match what the job description is looking for. But your professional accomplishments and achievements—with all their details and results—are yours alone. They tell hiring managers: “Here’s what I’ve done for my past employers. Imagine what I could do for you.”Where you can list accomplishments on a resumeThe vast majority of your achievements will be in yourexperience section, under your past jobs, but you can also highlight\\xa0impressive,relevantaccomplishments in other sections such as your:Resume summaryEducation section(especially if you’re early in your career)Volunteerandactivities sectionsAwards sectionProjects sectionHow to include accomplishments on your resumeSo you’ve decided to swap those boring job duties for your professional accomplishments from your past roles. Here’s how to do it:1. Choose the right accomplishments.Take a look at thejob descriptionfor the position you’re applying to. Make a note of any skills or experiences you have that line up with the required or preferred qualifications or the job duties you’d be responsible for. Then, think about which accomplishments best exemplify these skills and experiences.If you’re struggling, start by thinking about your major responsibilities. What were your goals? If you were responsible for managing a social media account, were you supposed to schedule a certain number of posts? Grow the follower count? Meeting one or more of these goals is an accomplishment—and exceeding them certainly is!2. Use strong action verbs.Traditionally, resume bullet points start with verbs.\\xa0 Choosingstrong, descriptive action verbs(in your bullet points and throughout your resume)\\xa0will\\xa0tell the reader more about your accomplishment—did youcreatea new process? Or did youstreamlineone? And don’t forget to\\xa0change them up so the first word of every line isn’t the same!3.Include theskillsand tools you used.Don\\'t forget to actuallysaywhatskillsyou’re trying to emphasize with each achievement—preferably using the same phrasing as the job description. If the posting specifically mentioned Salesforce experience as a requirement, for example, make sure you explicitly state that you used Salesforce to schedule all those meetings in your last job!4. Don’t forget the results.Even painting the most cinematic picture of everything you did and the hard work you put in can still leave a hiring manager or recruiter thinking, “So what?” That is, if you don’t include how your accomplishment helped your team, department, company, or clients.Remember, anyone looking at your resume wants to know what you can do for them—so show them what you’ve done for others. Did you save or make money? Increase efficiency? Grow reach or visibility?5. Add numbers.Whenever possible, you want toquantify your accomplishments, or add numbers to give them scale. If you work with numbers directly, this might be self-explanatory. But even if you don’t, you can add numbers to your achievements by mentioning:Time frames and frequencies for the tasks you’re describingThe number of times you did something or the amount of work products you handledMoney saved, earned, or managedThe number of employees, clients, or other stakeholders you managed, coordinated, or helpedPercent growth you saw and percentages of goals and KPIs you hitAudience sizeIf you don’t know the exact numbers or they varied over time, you can list a range (from three to six employees), an approximation (~$100,000), or a minimum (over 50 clients).70 example accomplishments for your resumeHere are some example achievements that you can use to inspire your resume:Entry-level job accomplishment examplesIf you’re writing a resume for an entry-level job or yourfirst jobever, you’re more likely to use accomplishments from your education and extracurricular activities.

Before you axe your resume skills section to make more space, read on to get the full picture of what you’d be giving up. And once you’re convinced not to scrap it, find out what types of skills you should include on a resume, how you should format a dedicated skills section, and how to figure the right skills for each job application.Why do I need a skills section?Overall, your resume skills section gives your application a nice optimization bump for both the human and digital review process. The whole point of keeping your resume concise is to allow a recruiter or hiring manager to figure out the value you could create for the company after just a quick skim.For certain roles, it can be a nonstarter for a candidate to not have specific skills. You can’t be a ballerina if you don’t know how to dance, obviously, just like you won’t get a front-end developer role if you don’t know HTML.Outside of these situations, however, the hiring managers I’ve spoken to are looking at the big picture. Monica Orta, a hiring manager at the MIT Media Lab, says the skills section gives her “a sense of the suite of skills a person has—it’s another way to look at their experience and helps paint a fuller picture.” They’re trying to connect the dots, and skills help fill in the gaps a bit.Another reality of the job application process is the ubiquity ofapplicant tracking systems (ATS)—software that most employers use to organize and parse candidate resumes. Keyword scanning is one way an ATS flags resumes for closer review, and a skills section, conveniently, can serve as an extra block of relevant keywords.What do I include in my skills section?Hiring managers are trying to pull together a story about you, so the first rule is that your skills section should match the experience you’ve written about in your resume.Here’s what you should include:Skills relevant tothisjobEach job will require different skills to be successful, so each skills section you write will be a bit different as well. But how do you figure out the right combination of skills for a particular job application? Check the answer key!That is, print out the job description of the role you’re interested in and take a highlighter to it (or copy and paste it into a doc and highlight there), marking any skills you see listed that you have. Then, make sure these skills are listed on your resume. For example, here’s a job description with some of the key skills bolded:Email Marketing ManagerResponsibilitiesManage email marketing strategy and calendarMonitor, analyze, and report on campaign performanceImprove campaign success throughconversion optimization, A/B testing, segmentation,and moreCollaborate with the design and editorial teams to maintain consistent brand and voice across platformsWork cross-functionally with sales, product, product marketing, and data teamsRequirements3+ years in email marketingExperience withcontent management systems and email service providers such as MailChimp or Constant ContactExperience withGoogle Analytics, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Microsoft Excel, and SEOa plusExcellent oral and written communication skillsTeam player with strong interpersonal, relationship-building, and stakeholder management skillsExcellent problem solving and time management skillsAnd here’s a list of skills you might include in your skills section if you were applying to the job:Conversion optimization, A/B testing, segmentation, MailChimp, Constant Contact, Google Analytics, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Microsoft Excel, SEOAll of that is just from one job description. Even better, find a few different job postings for the kind of role you’re interested in. Then, start looking for common skills among the different postings. These are the skills you definitely want on your resume—and likely in your skills section.When crafting your skills section, pay particular attention to skills that the employer is looking for, but haven’t necessarily been part of your daily job. Perhaps you took anonline courseon how to use InDesign or independently studied web design and HTML for your personal website. These skills will be absent from your experience section, which means the skills section is a great place to highlight them.Hard skillsYour resume skills section should mainly be reserved for yourhard skills. Think programming languages, business or design software, analytics programs, subject-matter expertise, or even carpentry skills—anything that can be taught, defined, and measured.Hiring managers often considersoft skills(like teamwork, communication, time management, and leadership) to be just as important as hard skills, if not more so. That said, these skills are not often included in a separate skills section since they’re usually intangible and harder to evaluate. While your soft skills are incredibly important, they’re better portrayed (and more believable) if you give them some context. So save your soft skills for resume bullets and your cover letter, where you can tell a story that shows them in action.Read More:Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills: What the Heck Is the Difference?Bonus skills that show your passionYou can also add skills that will show how passionate you are about the job. For example, one hiring manager I know in tech finds it interesting and noteworthy to see skills that are kind of esoteric, but still relevant. Functional programming languages in particular always catch his eye. To him, it indicates that the candidate has a keen interest in programming and possibly went out of their way to learn it on their own. That’s a pretty efficient way to show your enthusiasm—listing a juicy, related, but kind-of-obscure skill.Read More:The Right Way to Add Skills to Your Resume (With 250+ Example Skills)Whatshouldn’tI include in my skills section?Here’s what doesn\\'t belong in your skills section:Irrelevant skills:Particularly for people who are pivoting to another career, it can be a good branding move to not include the skills you don’t want to use anymore, especially if they’re not relevant or inherently interesting. For example, if you’re an executive assistant who wants to move into diversity and inclusion work, you probably don’t want to list all the flight booking and calendaring tools you’re familiar with. If you must include these skills in your experience section to accurately describe your previous roles, that’s fine, but don’t reiterate them in your skills section.Very basic skills:There’s generally no need to put “Microsoft Word” or similar on your resume, unless the job description specifically lists this skill.Skills you don’t have:Listing skills on a resume implies you’re confident in your abilities. So you should also leave off anything that you’re still working on or don’t feel comfortable training someone else in (like foreign languages you haven’t spoken since high school).Unrelated hobbies:You might be an amazing knitter, but that probably doesn’t belong in your skills section if you’re applying to be a social media manager for a hotel chain. (You can always include these kinds ofhobbiesunder “Interests,” of course.)How do I write a skills section?Hopefully, at this point you’ve been convinced to keep your skills section intact and perhaps even to add a couple things you hadn’t thought of before. But how do you best present all this important information in a way that isn’t just a jumble of keywords? That might be okay for an ATS, but no human being wants to read that. So follow these steps:1. Group your skills.Sort your skills into reasonable categories, then name each group of skills something appropriate. Think of subheadings as beautiful things that make even the most unruly mess of words look sleek and organized. For example, if you happen to be multilingual, a good subheading for all the languages you speak would be, unsurprisingly, “Languages.” Or if you’re a designer who also codes, label your sections “Design” and “Technical.”2. Format your skills section so it’s easy to read.For example, you might put each category on a new line with the subheading in bold at the beginning of the list. Even though this section is short, it still needs to be easy to skim. Bullets and subheadings prompt the reader to start reading again.3. Decide where to place your skills section.Generally a skills section lives at the bottom of a resume. It’s meant to reiterate or summarize what the reader learned from your experience section. There are some exceptions though. If you’re a career changer who’s been slowly accumulating the necessary skills for a shift, for example, it might make sense to move this section up to a more prominent spot on your resume—possibly even the top—to create ahybrid,functional, orskills-basedresume. If you work in a technical field where hard skills are paramount, you might also want to put your skills section at the top.Example skills sectionHere’s an example of a good skills section for someone who is looking for work as a designer:SKILLSVisual Design:InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere, XD, Animate, Lightroom3D Modeling & 2D Drafting:Rhino, VRay, AutoCAD, Vectorworks, Autodesk Fusion 360Programming:Grasshopper, Processing, HTML, CSSRegina Borsellinoalso contributed writing, reporting, and/or advice to this article.The Muse LogoA logo with \"the muse\" in white text.© 2024 Daily Muse Inc.About The MuseAbout UsCareersFAQsContact UsSearch JobsBrowse CompaniesTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyPopular JobsNew York JobsSan Francisco JobsSeattle JobsEngineering JobsMarketing JobsInformation Technology JobsSalariesSearch Job TitlesGet InvolvedFor EmployersFor PartnersThe Muse Book: The New Rules of WorkPodcast: The New Rules of WorkFor Career CoachesSend Feedback About The MuseTell A FriendJoin The ConversationFacebookLinkedInTwitterPinterestInstagram', '10 Resume Profile Examples (And How to Write Yours) | The MuseSkip to main contentThe Muse LogoA logo with &quat;the muse&quat; in dark blue text.JobsAccount ManagementAccounting and FinanceAdministration and OfficeAdvertising and MarketingArtsBusiness OperationsComputer and ITCustomer ServiceData and AnalyticsDesign and UXEducationHealthcareHuman Resources and RecruitmentManagementMedia, PR, and CommunicationsProduct ManagementProject ManagementSalesSoftware EngineeringWriting and EditingView All JobsCompaniesAdviceCoachingEmployersSign InSaved CompaniesAccount SettingsSign OutJob SearchFinding a JobResumesResume ExamplesCover LettersNetworkingInterviewingJob OfferView all in Job Search >Career PathsExploring CareersCareers in Data and AnalyticsCareers in FinanceCareers in MarketingCareers in SalesCareers in Software EngineeringCareer StoriesCareer ChangeTraining and DevelopmentView all in Career Paths >Succeeding at WorkWork and COVID-19ProductivityGetting AheadWork RelationshipsWork-Life BalanceWorking ParentsRemote WorkMoneyChanging JobsManagementBreak RoomView all in Succeeding at Work >Diversity and InclusionAnti-Racism at WorkLGBTQ at WorkDisability and WorkGender and WorkView all in Diversity and Inclusion >MoreVideosJob Search VideosCareer Advice VideosCareer Story VideosCompany Spotlight VideosIndustry Spotlight VideosEmployer ResourcesAdvice/Job Search/Resumes10 Resume Profile Examples (And How to Write Yours)byRegina BorsellinoUpdated3/25/2024FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailGetty ImagesImagine you\\'ve got everything covered in yourresume: You listed your past experiences, includedkeywordsfrom the job description, and pared it down to design elements anapplicant tracking system (ATS)can parse.

Curious? Read on to find out exactly what a resume profile is, and how to write yours—including examples.What is a resume profile?A resume profile is a few concise sentences or bullet points that can be placed at the top of your resume (below the header). It “describes who you are as a professional,” says Muse career coachYolanda Owens, founder ofCareerSenseiand who also worked as a college corporate recruiter for more than 20 years.Once you perfect your resume, check outopen jobson The Muse to maximize your chances»Career professionals don’t all agree on the exact contents of a resume profile, or even on whether it’s different from aresume summary. So you have a bit of flexibility in how you think about yours and what you include in it.For example, you might think of a resume profile as a way to “tell the reader who you are, what you do, and what you’re looking for,” so that you can grab their attention and “quickly showcase your accomplishments,” says Muse career coach and former recruiterJennifer Smith, founder ofFlourish Careers.Or you might approach your resume profile like Owens does, as the equivalent to “a dating profile that describes how you see yourself at work, and the type of work environment that makes you feel productive and purposeful.”What’s the difference between a resume summary and a profile?While some career coaches may use the terms resume summary and resume profile interchangeably, others treat them differently.The first is a quick synopsis of the relevant experiences and skills you bring to a role. The latter can do the same, but it can also focus on your traits and achievements, your story as a professional, and your desires for your next role.At this point, you might be wondering: If a resume profile includeswhat you’re looking for in your next role, how is it different from aresume objective? Some people say that resume objectives are outdated at best and a waste of space at worst. If that’s true, why is a resume profile acceptable?The difference lies in “the additional context that’s included in the profile,” says Smith. A traditional objective merely states what you’re looking for and maybe a vague reason why. But “the profile goes deeper into who you are and what you do” in addition to what you’re looking for next, connecting your past and present to your future.Is a resume profile necessary?Who should use it?Resume profiles can be advantageous for all job seekers, Smith says, especially for those “who are changing either their role or industry.” If you’re acareer changer, a strong, explicit resume profile will give you space to tell the reader right up front that, no, you didn’t apply to this job by mistake—this is the next step in your career and here’s why.Resume profiles are also particularly useful for entry-level job seekers who may need to tie their education and other experiences together more explicitly. If a candidate is writing anentry-level resume, Owens suggests that they “use the profile section to explain what they’re looking for in terms of challenges and learning, and the skills they possess that could potentially add value.”What to include in a resume profileThink about what you’d want the person reading your resume to know first. Is it something about your qualifications or your biggest accomplishment? Is it how well you work with others or what your personality adds to a team? This is what should go into your resume profile. You have a few sentences (or bullets) to work with, so don’t restrict yourself to highlighting just one thing.Here are a few types of information that you can include in a resume profile, according to our coaches:Relevant skills and experiencesRelevant achievements and accomplishmentsYears of experienceStrengths as a professional (bothsoftandhard skills)Signature traits related to the jobPersonal traits that contribute to your workQualities you’re looking for in your next role, team, or companyWillingness to relocate (if you’re applying to a job not near thelocationlisted on your resume)What are recruiters looking for in a resume profile?Don’t underestimate the power of a good first impression to get someone to keep reading the rest of your resume with interest. “The resume profile has an ability to quickly convince a recruiter that the person is a strong, qualified candidate,” says recruiter and Muse career coachSteven Davis, founder and CEO ofRenaissance Solutions.But recruiting isn’t just about making sure candidates have the right skills, Owens says. Recruiters also need to get a feel for whether the team and work environment will be a good match for the candidate long term.Candidates’ skills and experiences should be well represented throughout their resumes, so as a recruiter, Owens most often “looked at the profile as a way to get a sense of their work persona and gauge environment fit for the role.”How to write a profile for a resume: 5 stepsOnce you know what recruiters and hiring managers are looking for in your resume profile and what you’d like to portray, you can follow these tips as you write your own:1. Keep it conciseYour resume profile should be no more than four sentences or bullet points, and should not have more than 500 characters. Remember recruiters read dozens of resumes daily, so you don\\'t want yours to be unnecessarily long and tiring.2. Find the format the suits you bestDecide if you want to use either bullet points or paragraph form. Your resume profile can be written as bullet points, but keep in mind that bullet points often take up more space than a paragraph. “To preserve real estate on the resume and attempt to keep it toone to two pages, I always recommend using paragraph format,” Owens says.3. Consider the position you\\'re applying forTailor your profile to the job, but not so much that it’s not true to who you are. If your resume profile is closer to a summary that highlights your key qualifications and accomplishments as they relate to a given job, you should be tailoring it very carefully for each application and incorporating keywords from the job description.Read more:What it Really Means to \"Tailor Your Resume\"However, if your resume profile is more of a personal (but still professionally appropriate) description of yourself, Owens recommends against tailoring it to match each job: “What you don’t want to do is try to tell employers what you think they want to hear,” she says, if it doesn’t reflect who you are. “That’s how you end up in positions where you’re ultimately unhappy.”4. Quantify your experiences and accomplishmentsWhenever possible,quantify your experiences and accomplishmentsby adding numbers, percentages, and other metrics to your resume profile. Keep in mind that recruiters nowadays not only want to know what you did, but also what you achieved and the exact results of your work.5. Show some personalityWhile the rest of your resume won’t let much of your personality shine through, your profile gives you an opportunity for creativity. If you’re applying to a casual company, you can add a splash of personality, but if you’re applying to a more formal organization, it’s best to keep things more buttoned up.Resume profile: ExamplesWant to know what all this advice looks like in action?
